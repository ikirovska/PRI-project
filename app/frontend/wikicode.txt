==Etymology==
{{hatnote|See [[wikt:Paris|Wiktionary]] for the name of Paris in various languages other than English and French.}}
The ancient [[oppidum]] that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by [[Julius Caesar]] as ''Luteciam Parisiorum'' ('[[Lutetia]] of the [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]]')'','' and is later attested as ''Parision'' in the 5th century AD, then as ''Paris'' in 1265.{{Sfn|Nègre|1990|p=155}}<ref name="Falileyev" /> During the Roman period, it was commonly known as {{Lang|la|Lutetia}} or {{Lang|la|Lutecia}} in Latin, and as ''Leukotekía'' in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] root ''*lukot-'' ('mouse'), or from *''luto-'' ('marsh, swamp').{{Sfn|Lambert|1994|p=38}}{{Sfn|Delamarre|2003|p=211}}<ref name="Falileyev" />

The name ''Paris'' is derived from its early inhabitants, the [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]], a [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribe from the [[La Tène culture|Iron Age]] and the [[Roman period]].{{Sfn|Delamarre|2003|p=247}} The meaning of the Gaulish [[ethnonym]] remains debated. According to [[Xavier Delamarre]], it may derive from the Celtic root ''pario-'' ('cauldron').{{Sfn|Delamarre|2003|p=247}} [[Alfred Holder]] interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''peryff'' ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a [[Proto-Celtic]] form reconstructed as *''kwar-is-io''-.{{Sfn|Busse|2006|p=199}} Alternatively, [[Pierre-Yves Lambert]] proposed to translate ''Parisii'' as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the [[Old Irish]] ''carr'' ('spear'), derived from an earlier *''kwar-sā''.<ref name="Falileyev">{{harvnb|Falileyev|2010}}, s.v. ''Parisii'' and ''Lutetia''.</ref> In any case, the city's name is not related to the [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Greek mythology]].

Inhabitants are known in English as "Parisians" and in French as ''Parisiens'' ({{IPA-fr|paʁizjɛ̃||Parisien2.ogg}}). They are also pejoratively called ''Parigots'' ({{IPA-fr|paʁiɡo||Parigot.ogg}}).<ref group="note">The word was most likely created by Parisians of the lower popular class who spoke *argot*, then *parigot*was used in a provocative manner outside the Parisian region and throughout France to mean Parisians in general.</ref>{{sfn|Dottin|1920|p=535}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Paris}}
{{For timeline}}

===Origins===
{{main|Lutetia}}
The ''[[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]]'', a sub-tribe of the [[Celt]]ic [[Senones]], inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.{{sfn|Arbois de Jubainville|Dottin|1889|p=132}}{{sfn|Cunliffe|2004|p=201}} One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the [[Seine]] on the [[île de la Cité]], which gradually became an important trading centre.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=25}} The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=65–70}}
[[File:ParisiiCoins.jpg|thumb|Gold coins minted by the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] (1st century BC)]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the [[Paris Basin]] in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris's [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=88–104}} The Roman town was originally called [[Lutetia]] (more fully, ''Lutetia Parisiorum'', "Lutetia of the Parisii", modern French ''Lutèce''). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an [[amphitheatre]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=154–167}}

By the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the town was known as ''Parisius'', a [[Latin language|Latin]] name that would later become ''Paris'' in French.{{Sfn|Meunier|2014|p=12}} [[Christianity]] was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint [[Saint Denis of Paris|Denis]], the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as ''Mons Martyrum'' (Latin "Hill of Martyrs"), later "[[Montmartre]]", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], and many French kings are buried there.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210–211}}

[[Clovis I|Clovis the Frank]], the first king of the [[Merovingian dynasty]], made the city his capital from 508.<ref>Patrick Boucheron, et al., eds. ''France in the World: A New Global History'' (2019) pp 81–86.</ref> As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the [[Franks]] to Paris and the Parisian [[Francien]] dialects were born. Fortification of the [[Île de la Cité]] failed to avert [[Siege of Paris (845)|sacking by Vikings in 845]], but Paris's strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the [[Siege of Paris (885–886)]], for which the then [[Count of Paris]] (''comte de Paris''), [[Odo of France]], was elected king of [[West Francia]].{{sfn|Jones|1994|p=48}} From the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] dynasty that began with the 987 election of [[Hugh Capet]], Count of Paris and [[Duke of the Franks]] (''duc des Francs''), as king of a unified West Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210–211}}

===High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV===

[[File:Palais de la Cite.jpg|alt=The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410)|thumb|The [[Palais de la Cité]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle]], viewed from the Left Bank, from the [[Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] (month of June) (1410)]]

By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=27}} The [[Palais de la Cité]], the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], [[Maurice de Sully]], bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] at its eastern extremity.

After the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in from around the 10th century,{{sfn|Bussmann|1985|p=22}} Paris's cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's [[Les Halles]]) replaced the two smaller ones on the [[Île de la Cité]] and [[Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville – Esplanade de la Libération|Place de Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville)]].{{sfn|de Vitriaco|Hinnebusch|1972|p=262}} The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris's river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris's first municipal government.

In the late 12th century, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] extended the [[Louvre]] fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=36–40}} In 1190, he transformed Paris's former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the [[University of Paris]] and would draw students from all of Europe.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=27}}

With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants. By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by {{Lang|fr|merde}}, the French word for "shit".<ref>John Kelly, ''"The Great Mortality"'' (2005). pp 42</ref><ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/history/paris_history.htm |title=Paris history facts |date=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |access-date=6 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906195637/https://www.parisdigest.com/history/paris_history.htm |archive-date=6 September 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the late 16th-century [[French Wars of Religion]], Paris was a stronghold of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], the organisers of 24 August 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516821/Massacre-of-Saint-Bartholomews-Day |title=Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |access-date=23 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150458/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516821/Massacre-of-Saint-Bartholomews-Day |archive-date=4 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Bayrou|1994|pp=121–130}} The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris's first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the [[Pont Neuf]], built a Louvre extension connecting it to the [[Tuileries Palace]], and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now [[Place des Vosges]]. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris's streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near [[Les Halles]] marketplace in 1610.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=577}}

During the 17th century, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], chief minister of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the [[College of Sorbonne]], and a palace for himself, the [[Palais-Royal|Palais-Cardinal]]. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the [[Palais-Royal]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=582}}

Due to the Parisian uprisings during the [[Fronde]] civil war, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] moved his court to a new palace, [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the [[Comédie-Française]], the Academy of Painting, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the [[City walls of Paris|city walls]] demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the ''[[Boulevards of Paris#The grands boulevards|Grands Boulevards]]''.{{Sfn|Combeau|2003|pp=42–43}} Other marks of his reign were the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]], the [[Place Vendôme]], the [[Place des Victoires]], and [[Les Invalides]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=590–591}}

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|alt=|thumb|The storming of the [[Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, by [[Jean-Pierre Houël]]]]

[[File:Pantheon 2, Paris May 11, 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[Panthéon]], a major landmark on the [[Rive Gauche]], was completed in 1790.]]
Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity, known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] published their ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' in 1751, and the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] launched the first manned flight in a [[hot air balloon]] on 21&nbsp;November 1783. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, and the primary European centre of book publishing, fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=120}}

In the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the [[French Revolution]]. On 14&nbsp;July, a mob seized the arsenal at the [[Invalides]], acquiring thousands of guns, and [[storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]], which was a principal symbol of royal authority. The first independent [[Paris Commune (1789–1795)|Paris Commune]], or city council, met in the ''Hôtel de Ville'' and elected a [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], on 15&nbsp;July.{{sfn|Paine|1998|p=453}}

[[Louis XVI]] and the royal family were [[Women's march on Versailles|brought to Paris]] and incarcerated in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned increasingly radical, the king, queen and mayor were beheaded by [[guillotine]] in the [[Reign of Terror]], along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=674}} The property of the aristocracy and the church was [[Biens nationaux|nationalised]], and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=144}} A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|9&nbsp;November 1799]] (''coup d'état du 18 brumaire''), when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] seized power as First Consul.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=147}}

The population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but after 1799 it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000 by 1815.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=148}} Napoleon replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect that reported directly to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the [[Canal de l'Ourcq]], [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] and the city's first metal bridge, the [[Pont des Arts]].{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=148}}

[[File:Louis-Emile Durandelle, The Eiffel Tower - State of the Construction, 1888.jpg|thumb|The [[Eiffel Tower]], under construction in November 1888, startled Parisians—and the world—with its modernity.]]
During the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Restoration]], the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the [[July Revolution]] in 1830 (commemorated by the [[July Column]] on the [[Place de la Bastille]]) brought to power a constitutional monarch, [[Louis Philippe I]]. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the [[Provinces of France|provinces]] to the city.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=148}} In 1848, Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a [[French Revolution of 1848|popular uprising]] in the streets of Paris. His successor, [[Napoleon III]], alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], launched a huge public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the [[Bois de Boulogne]] and [[Bois de Vincennes]].{{sfn|De Moncan|2012|pp=7–35}} In 1860, Napoleon III annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.{{sfn|De Moncan|2012|pp=7–35}}

During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the [[Prussian Army]]. Following several months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28&nbsp;January 1871. After seizing power in Paris on 28&nbsp;March, a revolutionary government known as the [[Paris Commune]] held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the "[[Semaine sanglante|Bloody Week]]" at the end of May 1871.{{sfn|Rougerie|2014|p=118}}

In the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Universal Exposition]], which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Universal Exposition]] gave Paris the [[Pont Alexandre III]], the [[Grand Palais]], the {{Lang|fr|[[Petit Palais]]|italic=no}} and the first [[Paris Métro]] line.{{sfn|Fraser|Spalding|2011|p=117}} Paris became the laboratory of [[naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] ([[Émile Zola]]) and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] ([[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Paul Verlaine]]), and of [[Impressionism]] in art ([[Courbet]], [[Manet]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Renoir]]).{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=490–491}}

In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the [[Algerian War]] for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to [[Paris massacre of 1961|violent confrontations]] between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed.

For almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=334}} The first modern elected mayor of Paris was [[Jacques Chirac]], elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794.

The mayor of Paris is [[indirect election|elected indirectly]] by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the ''[[Conseil de Paris]]'' (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using [[closed list]] [[proportional representation]] in a [[two-round system]]. Party lists winning an [[absolute majority]] in the first round – or at least a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the [[highest averages method]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070239&idArticle=LEGIARTI000006353607&dateTexte=20141108 |title=Code électoral – Article L260 |language=fr |trans-title=Election Code – Article L260 |date=13 March 1983 |publisher=Legifrance |access-date=7 November 2014 |archive-date=25 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225102129/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070239&idArticle=LEGIARTI000006353607&dateTexte=20141108 |url-status=live}}</ref> This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.<ref name="Pariscouncil">{{cite web |title=Election Preview: France Municipal Elections 2014 – Part I |url=https://welections.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/election-preview-france-municipal-elections-2014-part-i/ |website=World Elections |date=22 March 2014 |access-date=4 January 2017 |archive-date=11 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011211513/https://welections.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/election-preview-france-municipal-elections-2014-part-i/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Prior to the [[2020 Paris municipal election]], each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council ({{Lang|fr|conseil d'arrondissement}}), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.{{sfn|Shales|2007|p=16}} The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=334}} The creation of [[Paris Centre]], a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election; the other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.paris.fr/pages/regroupement-des-4-premiers-arrondissements-le-secteur-paris-centre-sera-cree-le-6-avril-7384|title=Regroupement des 4 premiers arrondissements : le secteur Paris Centre sera créé le 11 juillet|work=Paris.fr|date=12 June 2020|access-date=15 November 2023}}</ref>

===Police force===

The security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the [[Prefecture of Police of Paris]], a subdivision of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]. It supervises the units of the [[National Police (France)|National Police]] who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the [[Paris Fire Brigade]]. Its headquarters is on [[Place Louis Lépine]] on the [[Île de la Cité]].<ref name="Presentation Generale">{{cite web |url=http://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/Presentation-generale |title=Présentation générale |trans-title=General Presentation |publisher=Police nationale — Ministère de l'intèrieur [National Police — Ministry of the Interior] |language=fr |access-date=22 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308061047/http://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/Presentation-generale |archive-date=8 March 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

There are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.<ref name="Presentation Generale"/> The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]] (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the [[National Gendarmerie]], a branch of the [[French Armed Forces]], though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr |title=Accueil |language=fr |trans-title=Home |publisher=Gendarmerie nationale — Ministère de l'intèrieur [National Gendarmerie — Ministry of the Interior] |access-date=22 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226055256/http://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/ |archive-date=26 December 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.<ref>{{cite web |title=France |website=Travel.State.Gov |publisher=U.S. Department of State |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/france.html |access-date=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404010203/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/france.html |archive-date=4 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Paris is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. For this, even its earliest history is still visible in its streetmap, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty played a large part in giving the city the reputation it has today.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Paris Street Evolution |journal=Scientific Reports |date=8 July 2013 |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=2153 |doi=10.1038/srep02153 |last1=Barthelemy |first1=Marc |last2=Bordin |first2=Patricia |last3=Berestycki |first3=Henri |last4=Gribaudi |first4=Maurizio |pmid=23835429 |s2cid=11824030 |pmc=3703887}}</ref> At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the [[Seine]]; of those, two remain today: [[Île Saint-Louis]] and the [[Île de la Cité]]. A third one is the 1827 artificially created [[Île aux Cygnes]].

Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to [[Napoleon III]] and his Prefect of the Seine, [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Baron Haussmann]]. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey "[[Paris stone]]". They also built the major parks around the city centre.<ref>De Moncan, Patrice, ''Le Paris de Haussmann'', Les Éditions de Mecene, Paris, {{ISBN|978-2-907970-98-3}}</ref> The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.{{sfn|Braimoh|Vlek|2008|p=12}}

Among these, {{formatnum:1165541}} (85.9 percent) were main residences, {{formatnum:91835}} (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).<ref name="insee_logement">{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=LOG&millesime=2011&typgeo=DEP&search=75 |title=Chiffres Cléfs Logements (2011) – Département de Paris (75) |publisher=INSEE |date=2011 |access-date=1 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904011013/http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=LOG&millesime=2011&typgeo=DEP&search=75 |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2019, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter.

===Suburbs===

Aside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative [[Seine (department)|Seine]] department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent "District de la région parisienne" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed "[[Île-de-France]]" in 1977, but this abbreviated "Paris region" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |title=Une brève histoire de l'aménagement de Paris et sa région Du District à la Région Île-de-France |access-date=26 November 2014 |publisher=DRIEA Île-de-France |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101005621/http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |archive-date=1 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the Métropole du [[Grand Paris]] came into existence.<ref name=MGP>{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |title=Code général des collectivités territoriales – Article L5219-1 |access-date=29 November 2015 |publisher=Legifrance |language=fr |trans-title=General Code of Territorial Communities – Article L5219-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101095821/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Paris's disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. [[Paul Delouvrier]] promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs ''mésentente'' when he became head of the Paris region in 1961:{{sfn|Masson|1984|p=536}} two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban "villes nouvelles" ("new cities"){{sfn|Yarri|2008|p=407}} and the [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] commuter train network.{{sfn|Gordon|2006|pp=46–47}} Many other suburban residential districts (''grands ensembles'') were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population:{{sfn|Castells|1983|p=75}} These districts were socially mixed at first,{{sfn|Tomas|Blanc|Bonilla|IERP|2003|p=237}} but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).<ref name="villes nouvelles">{{cite web |url=http://www.laburba.fr/app/download/7815645/Article+villes+nouvelles.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326035711/http://www.laburba.fr/app/download/7815645/Article%2Bvilles%2Bnouvelles.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2016 |title=Les Politiques Nationales du Logement et le Logement dans les Villes Nouvelles |publisher=Laburba.fr |access-date=25 November 2014 |page=6 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.<ref name="villes nouvelles"/>

These areas, ''quartiers sensibles'' ("sensitive quarters"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its [[Goutte d'Or]] and [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] [[department (France)|department]], and to a lesser extreme to the east in the [[Val-d'Oise]] [[department (France)|department]]. Other difficult areas are located in the [[Seine]] valley, in [[Évry (Essonne)|Évry]] et [[Corbeil-Essonnes]] ([[Essonne (département)|Essonne]]), in [[Les Mureaux|Mureaux]], [[Mantes-la-Jolie]] ([[Yvelines]]), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 "ville nouvelle" political initiative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sig.ville.gouv.fr/atlas/ZUS/ |title=Atlas des Zones urbaines sensibles (Zus) |access-date = 10 November 2014 |website=SIG du secretariat générale du SIV |publisher=Ministère de l'Egalité des Territoires et du Logement |language=fr |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170816133325/http://sig.ville.gouv.fr/atlas/ZUS/ |archive-date = 16 August 2017 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

The Paris agglomeration's [[urban sociology]] is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class dotted with wealthy islands located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]] to the east and [[Enghien-les-Bains]] to the north of Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=20&ref_id=20529&page=alapage/alap414/alap414_carte.htm#carte1 |title=Une forte hétérogénéité des revenus en Île-de-France |publisher=INSEE |access-date=26 November 2014 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229014922/http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=20&ref_id=20529&page=alapage%2Falap414%2Falap414_carte.htm#carte1 |archive-date=29 December 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The official estimated population of the City of Paris on 1 January 1, 2023 was 2,102,650, down from 2,165,423 on January 1, 2022, according to the [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]], the official French statistical agency. According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, [[Anne Hidalgo]], declared that this illustrated the "de-densification" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.<ref>"Paris Population Shrank By 122,000 Over Past Decade","Forbes Magazine", February 24, 2023</ref><ref>"Le Parisien, "Paris n'attire plus comme autrefois: année apres année, Paris perd des habitants": Le Parisien, 30 December 2021</ref> Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.<ref name="Le Monde, 22 January 2019">''Le Monde'', 22 January 2019</ref> This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Paris perd ses habitants, la faute à la démographie et aux... meublés touristiques pour la Ville."

Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following [[Berlin]], [[Madrid]] and [[Rome]].

The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.<ref>{{Cassini-Ehess|26207|Paris}}</ref> The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included [[de-industrialisation]], high rent, the [[gentrification]] of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.<ref>"Le Parisien", "Paris n'attire plus comme autrefois: année apres année, Paris perd des habitants": Le Parisien, 30 December 2021</ref><ref name="pophis">{{cite web |url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4515315?geo=COM-75056 |title=Population en historique depuis 1968: Commune de Paris (75056) |author=Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques |access-date=11 September 2020 |language=fr |author-link=INSEE |archive-date=15 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215061844/https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4515315?geo=COM-75056 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Painting and sculpture===
{{Main|Art in Paris}}
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|[[Auguste Renoir]], ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]'', 1876, oil on canvas, {{cvt|131|x|175|cm|0}}, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".{{sfn|Montclos|2003}} Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the [[French Baroque and Classicism]] era. Sculptors such as [[François Girardon|Girardon]], [[Antoine Coysevox|Coysevox]] and [[Nicolas Coustou|Coustou]] acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. [[Pierre Mignard]] became the first painter to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] during this period. In 1648, the ''[[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}}

Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and others. Paris was central to the development of [[Romanticism]] in art, with painters such as [[Théodore Géricault|Géricault]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} [[Impressionism]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Art Deco]] movements all evolved in Paris.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves.{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=19}} Artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and many others became associated with Paris.

The most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]] ([[Statue of Liberty]]), [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Camille Claudel]], [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Paul Landowski]] (statue of [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|''Christ the Redeemer'']] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]) and [[Aristide Maillol]]. The [[Belle Époque|Golden Age]] of the [[School of Paris]] ended between the two world wars.

===Theatre===
The largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical [[Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opéra]]) and modern [[Opéra Bastille]]; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=178}} In the middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique (which still exists), [[Théâtre-Italien]] and [[Théâtre Lyrique]] (which in modern times changed its profile and name to [[Théâtre de la Ville]]).{{Sfn|Schumacher|1996|p=60}} [[Philharmonie de Paris]], the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], where the first performances of Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]] took place in 1913.
[[File:CFfacadePlacedelOpera.png|thumb|The [[Comédie Française]] (Salle Richelieu)]]

Theatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the [[Comédie-Française]], founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the [[Palais-Royal]].{{Sfn|Fierro|1996|page=1173}} Other famous theatres include the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe]], also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Théâtre Mogador; and the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Who's Where |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tj4WAQAAIAAJ |access-date=2 July 2013 |date=1961 |page=304 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907162159/http://books.google.com/books?id=Tj4WAQAAIAAJ |archive-date=7 September 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The music hall and [[cabaret]] are famous Paris institutions. The ''[[Moulin Rouge]]'' was opened in 1889 and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French [[Cancan]]. It helped make famous the singers [[Mistinguett]] and [[Édith Piaf]] and the painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall [[Olympia Paris]] invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the ''[[Folies Bergère]]''. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer [[Josephine Baker]]. Later, Olympia Paris presented [[Dalida]], [[Edith Piaf]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Judy Garland]] and the [[Grateful Dead]].

The [[Casino de Paris]] presented many famous French singers, including [[Mistinguett]], [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Tino Rossi]]. Other famous Paris music halls include ''[[Le Lido]]'', on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Crazy Horse Saloon]], featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.{{Sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1005–1006}}

===Literature===
{{Main|Writers in Paris}}
[[File:Victor Hugo by Étienne Carjat 1876 - full.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|[[Victor Hugo]]]]
The first book printed in France, ''Epistolae'' ("Letters"), by [[Gasparinus de Bergamo]] (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by [[Johann Heynlin]]. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as [[Nicolas Boileau|Boileau]], [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[La Fontaine]], [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Charles Perrault]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k108017c.r=Labyrinte+de+Versailles+Perrault.langEN |title=scan of the book at the Bibliothèque nationale de France |publisher=Gallica.bnf.fr |date=15 October 2007 |access-date=24 March 2014 |archive-date=12 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140924/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k108017c.r=Labyrinte+de+Versailles+Perrault.langEN |url-status=live}}</ref> several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the {{Lang|fr|[[Académie française]]|italic=no}}.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=488}} In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Pierre de Marivaux]] and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]].

During the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Mérimée]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Guy de Maupassant]] and [[Honoré de Balzac]].

In the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as [[Colette]], [[André Gide]], [[François Mauriac]], [[André Malraux]], [[Albert Camus]], and, after World War II, by [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]], [[Alejo Carpentier]] and, [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]]. The winner of the 2014 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Patrick Modiano]], based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2014/bio-bibl.html |title=Official site of the Nobel Prize |access-date=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216224108/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2014/bio-bibl.html |archive-date=16 December 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Paris is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=840}} It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.<ref>"The French Still Flock to Bookstores", ''New York Times'', 20 June 2012</ref>

In the late 12th century, a school of [[polyphony]] was established at Notre-Dame. Among the [[Trouvères]] of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. [[Troubadours]], from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of [[Francis I of France|François I]], in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance era]], the [[lute]] became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers "disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy", and a national musical printing house was established.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} In the [[Baroque music|Baroque-era]], noted composers included [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], and [[François Couperin]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} The [[Conservatoire de Paris|''Conservatoire de Musique de Paris'']] was founded in 1795.{{sfn|Damschroeder|Williams|1990|p=157}} By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music.

[[Bal-musette]] is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls.{{sfn|Dregni|2004|p=19}} Patrons danced the [[bourrée]] to the accompaniment of the [[cabrette]] (a [[bellows]]-blown [[bagpipe]] locally called a "musette") and often the [[vielle à roue]] ([[hurdy-gurdy]]) in the cafés and bars of the city.

Immediately after the War the [[Saint-Germain-des-Pres]] quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, [[Le Tabou]]. They introduced Parisians to the music of [[Claude Luter]], [[Boris Vian]], [[Sydney Bechet]], [[Mezz Mezzrow]], and [[Henri Salvador]]. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.{{Sfn|Bezbakh|2004|page=872}}

Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] comes a close second, with major directors (''réalisateurs'') such as [[Claude Lelouch]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and [[Luc Besson]], and the more slapstick/popular genre with director [[Claude Zidi]] as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-27/news-interviews/36021870_1_tamil-films-screen-films-south-asian-films |title=2 Tamil Films in 1st SAFF in Paris |date=27 December 2012 |access-date=2 July 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130702190758/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-27/news-interviews/36021870_1_tamil-films-screen-films-south-asian-films |archive-date=2 July 2013 |work=[[The Times of India]] |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Le Zimmer, restaurant in Paris.jpg|thumb|Le Zimmer, on the [[Place du Châtelet]]]]
Since the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and ''[[haute cuisine]]'', food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the [[Palais-Royal]] by [[Antoine Beauvilliers]]; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant [[Le Grand Véfour]] in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=1136–1138}} The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the [[Au Rocher de Cancale|Rocher de Cancale]], the [[Café Anglais]], [[Maison dorée (Paris)|Maison Dorée]] and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', including [[Maxim's Paris|Maxim's]] on Rue Royale, [[Ledoyen]] in the gardens of the [[Champs-Élysées]], and the [[Tour d'Argent]] on the Quai de la Tournelle.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}}

Today, due to Paris's cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants.{{sfn|Dominé|2014}} The [[Michelin Guide]] has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as [[L'Ambroisie]] in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as [[L'Astrance]], which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including [[Pierre Gagnaire]], [[Alain Ducasse]], [[Yannick Alléno]] and [[Alain Passard]], have three-star restaurants in Paris.<ref>''Le Monde'', 2 February 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://restaurant.michelin.fr |title=Michelin Guide |publisher=[[Michelin Guide]] |access-date=23 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125110232/http://restaurant.michelin.fr/ |archive-date=25 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Lesdeuxmagots.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|fr|[[Les Deux Magots]]|italic=no}} café on Boulevard Saint-Germain]]
Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The [[Coffeehouse|café]] arrived in Paris in the 17th century, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The [[Café Procope]] on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially [[Café de la Rotonde]] and [[Le Dôme Café]] in Montparnasse and [[Café de Flore]] and {{lang|fr|[[Les Deux Magots]]|italic=no}} on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}} A [[bistro]] is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=715}} A [[brasserie]] originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the [[Paris Exposition of 1867]], it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=773}}

===Photography===
The inventor [[Nicéphore Niépce]] produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Niépce, [[Louis Daguerre]] patented the [[Daguerrotype]], which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} The work of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of [[Man Ray]] and [[Maurice Tabard]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/phsr/hd_phsr.htm Department of Photographs, ''Photography and Surrealism'', Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213005005/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/phsr/hd_phsr.htm |date=13 February 2015 }}, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2000.</ref>{{sfn|Hazan|2011|p=362}} Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including [[Eugène Atget]], noted for his depictions of street scenes, [[Robert Doisneau]], noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which ''Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville'' has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), [[Marcel Bovis]], noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as [[Jacques-Henri Lartigue]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} [[Poster art]] also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Jules Chéret]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Adolphe Willette]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges de Feure]], [[Henri-Gabriel Ibels]], [[Paul Gavarni]] and [[Alphonse Mucha]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}}

Paris is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. [[Île-de-France Mobilités]] (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region.<ref name="stif">{{cite web |url=http://www.stif-idf.fr |title=Le web des voyageurs franciliens |author=Syndicat des Transports d'Île-de-France (STIF) |access-date=10 April 2006 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411124843/http://www.stif-idf.fr/ |archive-date=11 April 2006}}</ref> The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the [[RATP Group|RATP]] (operating 347 [[Bus (RATP)|bus]] lines, the [[Paris Métro|Métro]], eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the [[SNCF]] (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the [[Optile]] consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.optile.com/notre-mission/ |title=Optile en bref |publisher=Optile |access-date=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208081030/http://www.optile.com/notre-mission/ |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

According to a 2018 INSEE survey, a majority of Parisians (64.3 percent) use public transport to get to work. Only 10.6 percent commuted to work by automobile. 10.5 percent walked or used roller skates; 5.5 percent commuted by bicycle; and 4.4 percent commuted by motorbike.<ref>INSEE Dossier complet

[[File:Paris - Station de métro Abbesses - PA00086748 - 001.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Paris Métro]] is the busiest subway network in the European Union.]]

A central hub of the national rail network, Paris's six major railway stations ([[Gare du Nord]], [[Gare de l'Est]], [[Gare de Lyon]], [[Gare d'Austerlitz]], [[Gare Montparnasse]], [[Gare Saint-Lazare]]) and a minor one ([[Gare de Bercy]]) are connected to three networks: [[high-speed rail]] lines ([[TGV]], [[Eurostar]], [[Thalys]], [[Intercity Express]], [[Frecciarossa]]), normal speed trains ([[Intercités]], [[Intercités de nuit]], [[Transport express régional|TER]]), and the suburban rails ([[Transilien]]). The Transilien is the [[commuter rail]] network serving [[Île-de-France|Paris region]] through 8 lines, 392 stations and {{cvt|1,294|km|mi|1}} of rails.

Since the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_5043/metro/ |title=Métro2030, notre nouveau métro de Paris |publisher=RATP |access-date=27 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101095822/http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_5043/metro/ |archive-date=1 January 2016}}</ref> through 16 lines, 308 stations (391 stops) and {{cvt|226.9|km|mi|1}} of rails. Superimposed on this is a '[[Réseau Express Régional|regional express network]]', the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and {{cvt|587|km|mi|0}} of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. In addition, the [[Île-de-France|Paris region]] is served by a light rail network, the [[Tramways in Île-de-France|tramway]]. Opened since 1992 for its first line, thirteen lines are currently operational. The network is {{convert|164.4|km|mi}} long with 248 stations.

Paris is a major international air transport hub with the [[World's busiest city airport systems by passenger traffic|5th busiest airport system in the world]]. The city is served by three commercial international airports: [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], [[Orly Airport]] and [[Beauvais–Tillé Airport]]. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 112 million passengers in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Bulletin_Statistique_2014.pdf |title=Bulletin statistique, trafic aérien commercial – année 2014 |page=15 |publisher=Direction générale de l'Aviation civile |access-date=28 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329083555/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Bulletin_Statistique_2014.pdf |archive-date=29 March 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> There is also one [[general aviation]] airport, [[Paris–Le Bourget Airport]], historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.side.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/EXPLOITATION/DEFAULT/doc/IFD/IFD_REFDOC_TEMIS_0077449/trafic-aeroportuaire-1986-2012-flux-de-trafic-commercial-1986-2012 |title=Trafic aéroportuaire 1986–2013 |pages=15–17 |publisher=Direction générale de l'Aviation civile |access-date=27 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170444/http://www.side.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/EXPLOITATION/DEFAULT/doc/IFD/IFD_REFDOC_TEMIS_0077449/trafic-aeroportuaire-1986-2012-flux-de-trafic-commercial-1986-2012 |archive-date=5 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> For 2017 it was the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic]] and it is the hub for the nation's [[flag carrier]] [[Air France]].{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|pp=278–283}} Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located {{cvt|69|km|abbr=off}} north of Paris's city centre, is used by charter airlines and [[low-cost carriers]].

====Motorways====
[[File:Boulevard_Périphérique_vu_depuis_Boulevard_Auteuil_-_Paris_XVI_(FR75)_-_2021-08-11_-_3.jpg|thumb|The [[Boulevard Périphérique]]]]
The city is also the most important hub of France's [[motorway]] network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the [[Périphérique (Paris)|Périphérique]],{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=69}} which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the [[A86 autoroute|A86]] motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the [[Francilienne]] motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over {{cvt|2000|km|mi|0}} of highways and motorways.

====Waterways====
The Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by [[Autonomous Port of Paris|Ports of Paris]] in facilities located around Paris. The rivers [[Loire]], [[Rhine]], [[Rhône]], [[Meuse]], and [[Scheldt]] can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the [[Canal Saint-Martin]], [[Canal Saint-Denis]], and the Canal de l'Ourcq.{{sfn|Jefferson|2009|p=114}}

====Cycling====
[[File:Station Velib DSC 3497.JPG|thumb|[[Vélib']] at the [[Place de la Bastille]]]]
There are {{cvt|440|km}} of [[Cycling in Paris|cycle paths and routes]] in Paris. These include ''piste cyclable'' (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers) and ''bande cyclable'' (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some {{cvt|29|km}} of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles.{{sfn|Hart|2004|p=355}} Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a [[community bicycle program|bike sharing]] system called [[Vélib']] with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations.{{sfn|Rand|2010|p=165}}

===Electricity===
Electricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. In 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the [[Île-de-France]] came from cogeneration energy plants; other energy sources included thermal power (35%), waste incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power.<ref name="prod_electrique_IDF">{{cite web |url=http://www.driee.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Seminaire_du_6_mars_2012_-_Presentations_Approvisionnement_electrique_du_Grand_Paris__cle2dcb2f-1.pdf |title=La production électrique en IdF |publisher=La DRIEE – Prefet de la région d'Île-de-France |access-date=11 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007034916/http://www.driee.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Seminaire_du_6_mars_2012_-_Presentations_Approvisionnement_electrique_du_Grand_Paris__cle2dcb2f-1.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> A quarter of the city's [[district heating]] is to come from a plant in [[Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine]], burning a 50/50-mix of coal and [[wood pellets]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwoodmarketsinfo.com/paris-to-import-wood-pellets-from-the-us/ |title=Paris to be heated with US wood pellets |work=Global Wood Markets Info |access-date=11 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312072201/http://www.globalwoodmarketsinfo.com/paris-to-import-wood-pellets-from-the-us/ |archive-date=12 March 2016 |url-status=live |date=11 March 2016}}</ref>

===Water and sanitation===
[[File:Ile de la Cite from Pont de la Tournelle.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Seine, the [[Île de la Cité]] and a [[Bateau Mouche]]]]
Paris in its early history had only the rivers Seine and [[Bièvre (river)|Bièvre]] for water. From 1809, the [[Canal de l'Ourcq]] provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paris.fr/pratique/musees-expos/musee-des-egouts/visite-publique-des-egouts-de-paris/rub_9691_stand_5943_port_23931 |title=Historique des égouts |access-date=18 June 2013 |language=fr |publisher=Paris.fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410232647/http://www.paris.fr/pratique/musees-expos/musee-des-egouts/visite-publique-des-egouts-de-paris/rub_9691_stand_5943_port_23931 |archive-date=10 April 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> From 1857, the civil engineer [[Eugène Belgrand]], under [[Napoleon III]], oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs.{{sfn|Burchell|1971|p=93}} From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris's principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris's streets.

Paris today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.{{Sfn|Jarrassé|2007|p=6}} Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the [[Tuileries Garden]] (created in 1564 for the [[Tuileries Palace]] and redone by [[André Le Nôtre]] between 1664 and 1672){{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=125}} and the [[Luxembourg Garden]], for the [[Luxembourg Palace]], built for [[Marie de' Medici]] in 1612, which today houses the [[Senate (France)|Senate]].{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=208}} The ''[[Jardin des plantes]]'' was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626.<ref>{{cite web |title=Le Jardin de Plantes |url=http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/foffice/tous/tous/guidePratique/lieuxVisiter/LieuxAVisiter/FLieuAVisiter.xsp?AE_ID=214&INFO_ID=21&LIEU_ID=158&MAN_ID=273&SITE_ID=10&i=1&idx=6&nav=liste |access-date=22 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615203149/http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/foffice/tous/tous/guidePratique/lieuxVisiter/LieuxAVisiter/FLieuAVisiter.xsp?i=1&nav=liste&INFO_ID=21&SITE_ID=10&AE_ID=214&LIEU_ID=158&idx=6&MAN_ID=273 |archive-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and the city's first director of parks and gardens, [[Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand]], created the [[Bois de Boulogne]], [[Bois de Vincennes]], [[Parc Montsouris]] and [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]], located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters.{{Sfn|Jarrassé|2007|pp=122–161}} Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the [[Parc de la Villette]] (1987), [[Parc André Citroën]] (1992), [[Parc de Bercy]] (1997) and [[Parc Clichy-Batignolles – Martin-Luther-King|Parc Clichy-Batignolles]] (2007).{{Sfn|Jarrassé|2007|pp=242–256}} One of the newest parks, the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]] (2013), built on a former highway on the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]] of the Seine between the [[Pont de l'Alma]] and the [[Musée d'Orsay]], has floating gardens.

===Cemeteries===
[[File:Catacombes De Paris.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Catacombs of Paris|Paris Catacombs]] hold the remains of approximately 6 million people.]]
During the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]] settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]], were filled to overflowing. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris's parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of [[Mines of Paris|Paris's stone mines]], today [[place Denfert-Rochereau]] in the 14th arrondissement.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=101}}{{sfn|Broadwell|2007|p=92}}

After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.{{sfn|Ayers|2004|p=271}} Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of [[Père Lachaise Cemetery|Père Lachaise]], [[Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Montparnasse]], and later [[Passy Cemetery|Passy]]. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the [[Saint-Ouen Cemetery|Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen]], the [[Cimetière parisien de Pantin]] (also known as Cimetière parisien de [[Pantin]]-[[Bobigny]]), the Cimetière parisien d'[[Ivry-sur-Seine|Ivry]], and the Cimetière parisien de [[Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine|Bagneux]].<ref name="Parisian Cemeteries">{{cite web |title=Les 20 cimetières Parisiens |url=http://www.paris.fr/cimetieres |publisher=Paris.fr |access-date=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170430/http://www.paris.fr/cimetieres |archive-date=5 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Famous people buried in Parisian cemeteries include [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Édith Piaf]] and [[Serge Gainsbourg]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Les célébrités du cimetière du Père Lachaise à Paris |url=https://www.oui.sncf/article/les-tombes-de-celebrites-au-cimetiere-du-pere-lachaise-106832 |website=www.oui.sncf |language=fr |access-date=20 April 2020 |archive-date=14 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414034945/https://www.oui.sncf/article/les-tombes-de-celebrites-au-cimetiere-du-pere-lachaise-106832 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[University of Paris]], founded in the 12th century, is often called the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] after one of its original medieval colleges.

The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the ''[[grandes écoles]]'' – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered ''[[grands établissements]]''. Most of the ''grandes écoles'' were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the [[École Normale Supérieure]], [[Paris Sciences et Lettres University|PSL University]] has remained on rue d'Ulm in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ens.fr/spip.php?article171&lang=en |title=Contact and Maps |access-date=18 June 2013 |language=fr |publisher=[[École Normale Supérieure]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607052638/http://www.ens.fr/spip.php?article171&lang=en |archive-date=7 June 2013}}</ref>
