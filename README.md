## M1 Feedback

* Change search tasks so they are more suitable for a full-text search (more like questions instead of pure X in Y)
* Add more information about universities (faculties etc.)
* ~~Add n-grams~~ - DONE - Wordclouds for unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and fourgrams are available
* Do NER analysis
