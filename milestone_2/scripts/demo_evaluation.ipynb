It is located on the River Cam approximately  north of London. As of the 2021 United Kingdom census, the population of Cambridge was 145,700. Cambridge became an important trading centre during the Roman and Viking ages, and there is archaeological evidence of settlement in the area as early as the Bronze Age. The first town charters were granted in the 12th century, although modern city status was not officially conferred until 1951.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is most famous as the home of the University of Cambridge, which was founded in 1209 and consistently ranks among the best universities in the world. The buildings of the university include King\\'s College Chapel, Cavendish Laboratory, and the Cambridge University Library, one of the largest legal deposit libraries in the world. The city\\'s skyline is dominated by several college buildings, along with the spire of the Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church, and the chimney of Addenbrooke\\'s Hospital. Anglia Ruskin University, which evolved from the Cambridge School of Art and the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, also has its main campus in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge is at the heart of the high-technology Silicon Fen, which contains industries such as software and bioscience and many start-up companies born out of the university. Over 40 per cent of the workforce have a higher education qualification, more than twice the national average. The Cambridge Biomedical Campus, one of the largest biomedical research clusters in the world, includes the headquarters of AstraZeneca and the relocated Royal Papworth Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first game of association football took place at Parker\\'s Piece. The Strawberry Fair music and arts festival and Midsummer Fair are held on Midsummer Common, and the annual Cambridge Beer Festival takes place on Jesus Green. The city is adjacent to the M11 and A14 roads. Cambridge station is less than an hour from London King\\'s Cross railway station.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nPrehistory\\r\\n\\r\\nSettlements have existed around the Cambridge area since prehistoric times. The earliest clear evidence of occupation is the remains of a year-old farmstead discovered at the site of Fitzwilliam College. Archaeological evidence of occupation through the Iron Age is a settlement on Castle Hill from the 1st century BC, perhaps relating to wider cultural changes occurring in southeastern Britain linked to the arrival of the Belgae.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoman\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal Roman site is a small fort () Duroliponte on Castle Hill, just northwest of the city centre around the location of the earlier British village. The fort was bounded on two sides by the lines formed by the present Mount Pleasant, continuing across Huntingdon Road into Clare Street. The eastern side followed Magrath Avenue, with the southern side running near to Chesterton Lane and Kettle\\'s Yard before turning northwest at Honey Hill. It was constructed around AD\\xa070 and converted to civilian use around 50 years later. Evidence of more widespread Roman settlement has been discovered, including numerous farmsteads and a village in the Cambridge district of Newnham.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedieval\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|Trinity Street in 2008 with Trinity College on the left and St John\\'s College in the background\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|St Bene\\'t\\'s Church, the oldest standing building in Cambridgeshire, next to Corpus Christi College\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|Peterhouse was the first college to be founded at the University of Cambridge.\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|The President\\'s Lodge, Queens\\' College\\r\\nFollowing the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the location may have been abandoned by the Britons, although the site is usually identified as ,Nennius ().

Hosted at Latin Wikisource. as listed among the 28 cities of Britain in the History of the Britons attributed to Nennius.Ford, David Nash. \"The 28 Cities of Britain \" at Britannia. 2000. Evidence exists that the invading Anglo-Saxons had begun occupying the area by the end of the century. Their settlement – also on and around Castle Hill – became known as Grantebrycge (\"Granta-bridge\"). (By Middle English, the settlement\\'s name had changed to \"Cambridge\", deriving from the word \\'Camboricum\\', meaning \\'Passage\\' or \\'ford\\' of stream in a town or settlement,A Dictionary, english-latin, and latin-english containing all things necessary for the translating of either language into the other\\r\\nBy Elisha Coles · 1679A Restoration of the Ancient Modes of Bestowing Names on the Rivers, Hills, Vallies, Plains, and Settlements of Britain by Gilbert Dyer Publication date 1805 (page 242) and the lower stretches of the Granta changed their name to match.) Anglo-Saxon grave goods have been found in the area. During this period, Cambridge benefited from good trade links across the hard-to-travel fenlands. By the 7th century, the town was less significant and described by Bede as a \"little ruined city\" containing the burial site of Æthelthryth (Etheldreda). Cambridge sat on the border between the East and Middle Anglian kingdoms, and the settlement slowly expanded on both sides of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Vikings arrived in 875; they imposed Viking rule, the Danelaw, by 878. Their vigorous trading habits resulted in rapid growth of the town. During this period, the town\\'s centre shifted from Castle Hill on the left bank of the river to the area now known as the Quayside on the right bank. After the Viking period, the Saxons enjoyed a return to power, building churches, such as St Bene\\'t\\'s Church, as well as wharves, merchant houses, and a mint which produced coins with the town\\'s name abbreviated to \"Grant\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1068, two years after the Norman Conquest of England, William the Conqueror erected a castle on Castle Hill, the motte of which survives. Like the rest of the newly conquered kingdom, Cambridge fell under the control of the King and his deputies.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge\\'s first town charter was granted by Henry I between 1120 and 1131. It granted the town monopoly of waterborne traffic and hithe tolls and recognised the borough court. The distinctive Round Church dates from this period. In 1209, Cambridge University was founded by Oxford students fleeing from hostility. The oldest existing college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1349, Cambridge was affected by the Black Death. Few records survive but 16 of 40 scholars at King\\'s Hall died. The town north of the river was severely impacted, being almost wiped out. Following further depopulation after a second national epidemic in 1361, a letter from the Bishop of Ely suggested that two parishes in Cambridge be merged as there were not enough people to fill even one church. With more than a third of English clergy dying in the Black Death, four new colleges were established at the university over the following years to train new clergymen, namely Gonville Hall, Trinity Hall, Corpus Christi, and Clare.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1382, a revised town charter effected a \"diminution of the liberties that the community had enjoyed\", due to Cambridge\\'s participation in the Peasants\\' Revolt. This charter transferred supervision of baking and brewing, weights and measures, and forestalling and regrating, from the town to the university.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing\\'s College Chapel was begun in 1446 by King Henry VI. Built in phases by a succession of kings of England from 1446 to 1515 — its history intertwined with the Wars of the Roses — the chapel was completed during the reign of King Henry VIII. The building would become synonymous with Cambridge, and currently is used in the logo for the Cambridge City Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly modern\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|right|Cambridge in 1575\\r\\nFollowing repeated outbreaks of pestilence throughout the 16th century, sanitation and fresh water were brought to Cambridge by the construction of Hobson\\'s Conduit in the early 1600s. Water was brought from Nine Wells, at the foot of the Gog Magog Hills to the southeast of Cambridge, into the centre of the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge played a significant role in the early part of the English Civil War as it was the headquarters of the Eastern Counties Association, an organisation administering a regional East Anglian army, which became the mainstay of the Parliamentarian military effort before the formation of the New Model Army. In 1643 control of the town was given by Parliament to Oliver Cromwell, who had been educated at Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge. The town\\'s castle was fortified and garrisoned with troops and some bridges were destroyed to aid its defence. Although Royalist forces came within  of the town in 1644, the defences were never used, and the garrison was stood down the following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly-industrial era\\r\\nIn the 19th century, in common with many other English towns, Cambridge expanded rapidly, due in part to increased life expectancy and improved agricultural production leading to increased trade in town markets. The Inclosure Acts of 1801 and 1807 enabled the town to expand over surrounding open fields and in 1912 and again in 1935 its boundaries were extended to include Chesterton, Cherry Hinton, and Trumpington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railway came to Cambridge in 1845 after initial resistance, with the opening of the Great Eastern Railway\\'s London to Norwich line. The station was outside the town centre following pressure from the university to restrict travel by undergraduates. With the arrival of the railway and associated employment came development of areas around the station, such as Romsey Town. The rail link to London stimulated heavier industries, such as the production of brick, cement and malt.\\r\\n\\r\\n20th and 21st centuries\\r\\nFrom the 1930s to the 1980s, the size of the city was increased by several large council estates. The biggest impact has been on the area north of the river, which are now the estates of East Chesterton, King\\'s Hedges, and Arbury where Archbishop Rowan Williams lived and worked as an assistant priest in the early 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, Cambridge was an important centre for defence of the east coast. The town became a military centre, with an R.A.F. training centre and the regional headquarters for Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire established during the conflict. The town itself escaped relatively lightly from German bombing raids, which were mainly targeted at the railway. 29 people were killed and no historic buildings were damaged. In 1944, a secret meeting of military leaders held in Trinity College laid the foundation for the allied invasion of Europe. During the war Cambridge served as an evacuation centre for over 7,000 people from London, as well as for parts of the University of London.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge was granted its city charter in 1951 in recognition of its history, administrative importance and economic success. Cambridge does not have a cathedral, traditionally a prerequisite for city status, instead falling within the Church of England Diocese of Ely. In 1962, Cambridge\\'s first shopping arcade, Bradwell\\'s Court, opened on Drummer Street, though this was demolished in 2006. Other shopping arcades followed at Lion Yard, which housed a relocated Central Library for the city, and the Grafton Centre which replaced Victorian housing stock which had fallen into disrepair in the Kite area of the city. This latter project was controversial at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city gained its second University in 1992 when Anglia Polytechnic became Anglia Polytechnic University. Renamed Anglia Ruskin University in 2005, the institution has its origins in the Cambridge School of Art opened in 1858 by John Ruskin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernance\\r\\nLocal government\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the 2010 electoral boundaries of the city with postcode districts superimposed\\r\\nCambridge is a non-metropolitan district – one of six districts within the county of Cambridgeshire – and is administered by Cambridge City Council. The district covers most of the city\\'s urban area, although some suburbs extend into the surrounding South Cambridgeshire district. The city council\\'s headquarters are in the Guildhall, a large building in the market square. Cambridge was granted a Royal Charter by King John in 1207, which permitted the appointment of a mayor, although the first recorded mayor, Harvey FitzEustace, served in 1213. City councillors now elect a mayor annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor electoral purposes the city is divided into 14 wards: Abbey, Arbury, Castle, Cherry Hinton, Coleridge, East Chesterton, King\\'s Hedges, Market, Newnham, Petersfield, Queen Edith\\'s, Romsey, Trumpington, and West Chesterton. At the 2019 election, Labour retained its majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the 14 wards also elects councillors to Cambridgeshire County Council, which is responsible for services including school education, social care and highways.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2017, Cambridge has also been within the area of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, which is led by a directly elected Mayor. The city is represented on the authority by the leader of the City Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nWestminster\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parliamentary constituency of Cambridge covers most of the city; Daniel Zeichner (Labour) has represented the seat since the 2015 general election. The seat was generally held by the Conservatives until it was won by Labour in 1992, then taken by the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010, before returning to Labour in 2015. A southern area of the city, Queen Edith\\'s ward, falls within the South Cambridgeshire constituency, whose MP is Anthony Browne (Conservative), first elected in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge formerly had two seats in the House of Commons; Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most notable MPs. The Cambridge University constituency was abolished under 1948 legislation, and ceased at the dissolution of Parliament for the 1950 general election, along with the other university constituencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeography and environment\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|Aerial view of Cambridge\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|Old Court at Clare College as seen from The Backs\\r\\nCambridge is situated about  north-by-east of London and  east of Birmingham. The city is located in an area of level and relatively low-lying terrain just south of the Fens, which varies between  above sea level. The town was thus historically surrounded by low-lying wetlands that have been drained as the town has expanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe underlying geology of Cambridge consists of gault clay and Chalk Marl, known locally as Cambridge Greensand, partly overlaid by terrace gravel. A layer of phosphatic nodules (coprolites) under the marl was mined in the 19th century for fertiliser; this became a major industry in the county, and its profits yielded buildings such as the Corn Exchange, Fulbourn Hospital, and St. John\\'s Chapel until the Quarries Act 1894 and competition from America ended production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe River Cam flows through the city from the village of Grantchester, to the southwest. It is bordered by water meadows within the city such as Sheep\\'s Green as well as residential development. Like most cities, modern-day Cambridge has many suburbs and areas of high-density housing. The city centre of Cambridge is mostly commercial, historic buildings, and large green areas such as Jesus Green, Parker\\'s Piece and Midsummer Common. Some of the roads in the centre are pedestrianised.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation growth has seen new housing developments in the 21st century, with estates such as the CB1 and Accordia schemes near the station, and developments such as Great Kneighton, formally known as Clay Farm, and Trumpington Meadows currently under construction in the south of the city. Other major developments currently being constructed in the city are Darwin Green (formerly NIAB), and University-led developments at West Cambridge and North West Cambridge, (Eddington).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire city centre, as well as parts of Chesterton, Petersfield, West Cambridge, Newnham, and Abbey, are covered by an Air Quality Management Area, implemented to counter high levels of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate\\r\\nThe city has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb). Cambridge has an official weather observing station, at the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, about  south of the city centre. In addition, the Digital Technology Group of the university\\'s Department of Computer Science and Technology maintains a weather station on the West Cambridge site, displaying current weather conditions online via web browsers or an app, and also an archive dating back to 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city, like most of the UK, has a maritime climate highly influenced by the Gulf Stream. Located in the driest region of Britain, Cambridge\\'s rainfall averages around  per year, around half the national average, The driest recent year was in 2011 with  of rain at the Botanic Garden and  at the NIAB site. This is just below the semi-arid precipitation threshold for the area, which is 350mm of annual precipitation. Conversely, 2012 was the wettest year on record, with  reported. Snowfall accumulations are usually small, in part because of Cambridge\\'s low elevation, and low precipitation tendency during transitional snow events.\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to its low-lying, inland, and easterly position within the British Isles, summer temperatures tend to be somewhat higher than areas further west, and often rival or even exceed those recorded in the London area. Cambridge also often records the annual highest national temperature in any given year\\xa0–  in July 2008 at NIAB and  in August 2007 at the Botanic Garden are two recent examples. Other years include 1876, 1887, 1888, 1892, 1897, 1899 and 1900. The absolute maximum stands at  recorded on 19 July 2022 at Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Before this date, Cambridge held the record for the all-time maximum temperature in the UK, after recording  on 25 July 2019. Typically the temperature will reach  or higher on over 25 days of the year over the 1981–2010 period, with the annual warmest day averaging  over the same period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absolute minimum temperature recorded at the Botanic Garden site was , recorded in February 1947, although a minimum of  was recorded at the now defunct observatory site in December 1879. More recently the temperature fell to  on 11 February 2012,  on 22 January 2013 and  on 20 December 2010. The average frequency of air frosts ranges from 42.8 days at the NIAB site, to 48.3 days at the Botanic Garden per year over the 1981–2010 period. Typically the coldest night of the year at the Botanic Garden will fall to . Such minimum temperatures and frost averages are typical for inland areas across much of southern and central England.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunshine averages around 1,500 hours a year or around 35% of possible, a level typical of most locations in inland central England.\\r\\n\\r\\nEcology\\r\\nThe city contains three Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), at Cherry Hinton East Pit, Cherry Hinton West Pit, and Travellers Pit, and ten Local Nature Reserves (LNRs): Sheep\\'s Green and Coe Fen,\\r\\nColdham\\'s Common, Stourbridge Common, Nine Wells, Byron\\'s Pool, West Pit, Paradise, Barnwell West, Barnwell East, and Logan\\'s Meadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n Green belt \\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge is completely enclosed by green belt as a part of a wider environmental and planning policy first defined in 1965 and formalised in 1992. While some small tracts of green belt exist on the fringes of the city\\'s boundary, much of the protection is in the surrounding South Cambridgeshire and nearby East Cambridgeshire districts, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further urban sprawl and unplanned expansion of the city, as well as protecting smaller outlying villages from further convergence with each other as well as the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemography\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.1|Population pyramid of Cambridge in 2021\\r\\nthumb|UK born and foreign born population pyramid in Cambridge in 2021\\r\\nAt the 2011 census, the population of the Cambridge contiguous built-up area (urban area) was 158,434, while that of the City Council area was 123,867.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2001 Census held during University term, 89.44% of Cambridge residents identified themselves as white, compared with a national average of 92.12%.2001 Census (Ethnic group, Cambridge local authority).

King Henry I granted Cambridge a monopoly on river trade, privileging this area of the economy of Cambridge. The town market provided for trade in a wide variety of goods and annual trading fairs such as Stourbridge Fair and Midsummer Fair were visited by merchants from across the country. The river was described in an account of 1748 as being \"often so full of [merchant boats] that the navigation thereof is stopped for some time\". For example, 2000 firkins of butter were brought up the river every Monday from the agricultural lands to the northeast, particularly Norfolk, to be unloaded in the town for road transportation to London. Changing patterns of retail distribution and the advent of the railways led to a decline in Cambridge\\'s importance as a market town.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge today has a diverse economy with strength in sectors such as research and development, software consultancy, high value engineering, creative industries, pharmaceuticals and tourism. Described as one of the \"most beautiful cities in the world\" by Forbes in 2010, with the view from The Backs being selected as one of the 10 greatest in England by National Trust chair Simon Jenkins. Tourism generates over £750\\xa0million for the city\\'s economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge and its surrounds are sometimes referred to as Silicon Fen, an allusion to Silicon Valley, because of the density of high-tech businesses and technology incubators that have developed on science parks around the city. Many of these parks and buildings are owned or leased by university colleges, and the companies often have been spun out of the university. Cambridge Science Park, which is the largest commercial R&D centre in Europe, is owned by Trinity College; St John\\'s is the landlord of St John\\'s Innovation Centre. Technology companies include Abcam, CSR, ARM Limited, CamSemi, Jagex and Sinclair. Microsoft has located its Microsoft Research UK offices in West Cambridge, separate from the main Microsoft UK campus in Reading, and also has an office on Station Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge was also the home of Pye Ltd, founded in 1898 by W. G. Pye, who worked in the Cavendish Laboratory; it began by supplying the university and later specialised in wireless telegraphy equipment, radios, televisions and also defence equipment. Pye Ltd evolved into several other companies including TETRA radio equipment manufacturer Sepura. Another major business is Marshall Aerospace located on the eastern edge of the city. The Cambridge Network keeps businesses in touch with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransport\\r\\n\\r\\n Air \\r\\nCambridge City Airport has no scheduled services and is used mainly by charter and training flights and by Marshall Aerospace for aircraft maintenance.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world\\'s third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university\\'s founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople. The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge\\'s 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16\\xa0million books, around nine\\xa0million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world\\'s largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes. Among the university\\'s notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes\"All Known Cambridge Olympians \". Hawks Club. Retrieved 17 May 2019. and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nFounding\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford\\'s town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university\\'s formation. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set secundum consuetudinem universitatis, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university ius non trahi extra, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Cambridge was described as a studium generale in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290, and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII\\'s 1318 papal bull, it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n Foundation of the colleges \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Emmanuel College Chapel\\r\\nthumb|Peterhouse, Cambridge\\'s first college, founded in 1284\\r\\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself. The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge\\'s first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university\\'s newest full college.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges  often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges\\' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII\\'s order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university\\'s faculty and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties\\' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ\\'s Colleges.Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629–1640, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994, 19. These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n Mathematics and mathematical physics \\r\\n\\r\\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university\\'s examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos, was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is highly competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Lord Rayleigh. However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the Tripos system, feeling that students were becoming too focused on accumulating high exam marks at the expense of the subject itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nPure mathematics at the University of Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, though it largely missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, pure mathematical research at Cambridge reached the highest international standard, thanks largely to G. H. Hardy and his collaborators, J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. W. V. D. Hodge and others helped establish Cambridge as a global leader in geometry in the 1930s.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern period\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Selwyn College, founded in 1882\\r\\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university\\'s organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages. Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816. In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university\\'s chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university\\'s grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences. During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.John Aldrich – \"The Maths PhD in the UK: Notes on its History – Economics\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies\\' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a hault during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant. Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists. This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.\\r\\n\\r\\n Parliamentary representation \\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\\r\\n\\r\\n Women\\'s education \\r\\nthumb|Newnham College, one of two female-only colleges at the university\\r\\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century. Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive ad eundem degrees from the University of Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1921, women were awarded diplomas that conferred the title associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university\\'s governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King\\'s Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women\\'s colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. As a result of St Hilda\\'s College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are  Newnham and Murray Edwards. As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university\\'s male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.\"\\'This isn\\'t right. My rapist is still in my college\\' ,\" Varsity News, 16 November 2018.\"She reported her rape to the University, then it was dismissed: How a second student\\'s complaint was stopped in its tracks ,\" Varsity News, 28 July 2019. In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.Rosie Bradbury, \"Cambridge graduate suing University over handling of sexual misconduct complaint ,\" Varsity News, 13 August 2019. In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.James Tapper, \"Students slam Cambridge over handling of sexual misconduct cases ,\" The Guardian, 22 February 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nTown and gown\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge\\'s residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants\\' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge\\'s academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\". Following these events, the University of Cambridge\\'s Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. Attempts at reconciliation between the city\\'s residents and students followed; in the 16th century, agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague reached Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to assist those affected by the disease by locking their sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge\\'s residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region. The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university\\'s high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n Myths, legends and traditions \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Mathematical Bridge crossing River Cam at Queens\\' College\\r\\nPartly because of the University of Cambridge\\'s extensive history, which now exceeds 800 years, the university has developed a large number of traditions, myths, and legends. Some are true, some are not, and some were true but have been discontinued but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university\\'s Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John\\'s College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John\\'s College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Christmas Eve, The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, sung by the Choir of King\\'s College, are broadcast globally on BBC World Service television and radio and syndicated to hundreds of additional radio stations in the U.S. and elsewhere. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas Eve tradition since 1928, though the festival has existed since 1918 and the celebration itself originated even earlier at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall in 1880. The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocations and buildings\\r\\nthumb|The entrance to the original Cavendish Laboratory on the New Museums Site\\r\\nthumb|The Faculty of Education building\\r\\nthumb|The Faculty of Law building on the Sidgwick Site\\r\\n Buildings \\r\\n\\r\\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town\\'s population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the university\\'s older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university\\'s buildings and campuses that surround the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King\\'s College Chapel, the history faculty building designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John\\'s College./ The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens\\' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England and the brick walls of St John\\'s College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.\\r\\n\\r\\n Sites \\r\\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university\\'s various departments, including:\\r\\n\\r\\n Addenbrooke\\'s Hospital\\r\\n Downing Site\\r\\n Madingley/Gorton\\r\\n New Museums Site\\r\\n North West Cambridge Development\\r\\n Old Addenbrooke\\'s Site\\r\\n Old Schools\\r\\n Silver Street/Mill Lane\\r\\n Sidgwick Site\\r\\n West Cambridge\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university\\'s School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke\\'s Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree. The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports. Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by Financial Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable locations\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nBridge of Sighs, Cambridge\\r\\nCambridge University Botanic Garden\\r\\nChurch of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\\r\\nDowning Site\\r\\nFenner\\'s\\r\\nGoldie Boathouse\\r\\nKing\\'s College Chapel, Cambridge\\r\\nLady Mitchell Hall\\r\\nMathematical Bridge\\r\\nNevile\\'s Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\\r\\nSidgwick Site\\r\\nSt Bene\\'t\\'s Church\\r\\nThe Backs\\r\\nTrinity College Chapel, Cambridge\\r\\nWest Cambridge\\r\\n\\r\\n Organisation and administration \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|View over Trinity College, Gonville and Caius College, Trinity Hall, and Clare College towards King\\'s College Chapel seen from St John\\'s College Chapel on the left. In front of King\\'s College Chapel is the Senate House\\r\\nCambridge is a collegiate university, which means that its colleges are self-governing and independent, each with its own property, endowments, and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university\\'s general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university\\'s largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university\\'s students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college\\'s respective undergraduates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n Colleges \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Gonville and Caius College\\r\\nthumb|Margaret Wileman Building at Hughes Hall \\r\\nthumb|upright=1|The President\\'s Lodge at Queens\\' College\\r\\nthumb|Bridge of Sighs over the River Cam at St John\\'s College\\r\\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges\\' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student\\'s particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge has 31 colleges, two of which, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King\\'s were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates. In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women. Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund\\'s, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021. All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nColleges are not required to admit students in all subjects; some colleges choose not to offer subjects such as architecture, art history, or theology, but most offer a complete range of academic specialties and related courses. Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college\\'s founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences. Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King\\'s, which is known for its left-wing political orientation, and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college. Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge\\'s 31 colleges are:\\r\\n\\r\\n 12px|Christ\\'s College heraldic shield Christ\\'s\\r\\n 12px|Churchill College heraldic shield Churchill\\r\\n 12px|Clare College heraldic shield Clare\\r\\n 12px|Clare Hall heraldic shield Clare Hall\\r\\n 12px|Corpus Christi heraldic shield Corpus Christi\\r\\n 12px|Darwin College heraldic shield Darwin\\r\\n 12px|Downing College heraldic shield Downing\\r\\n 12px|Emmanuel College heraldic shield Emmanuel\\r\\n 12px|Fitzwilliam College heraldic shield Fitzwilliam\\r\\n 12px Girton\\r\\n 12px|Gonville and Caius College heraldic shield Gonville & Caius\\r\\n 12px Homerton\\r\\n 12px|Hughes Hall heraldic shield Hughes Hall\\r\\n 12px|Jesus College heraldic shield Jesus\\r\\n 12px|King\\'s College heraldic shield King\\'s\\r\\n 12px|Lucy Cavendish College heraldic shield Lucy Cavendish\\r\\n 12px|Magdalene College heraldic shield Magdalene\\r\\n 12px Murray Edwards\\r\\n 12px|Newnham College heraldic shield Newnham\\r\\n 12px|Pembroke College heraldic shield Pembroke\\r\\n 12px|Peterhouse coat of arms Peterhouse\\r\\n 12px|Queens\\' College heraldic shield Queens\\'\\r\\n 12px|Robinson College heraldic shield Robinson\\r\\n 12px|Selwyn College heraldic shield Selwyn\\r\\n 12px|Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield Sidney Sussex\\r\\n 12px|St Catharine\\'s College heraldic shield St Catharine\\'s\\r\\n 12px St Edmund\\'s\\r\\n 12px|St John\\'s College heraldic shield St John\\'s\\r\\n 12px|Trinity College coat of arms Trinity\\r\\n 12px|Trinity Hall heraldic shield Trinity Hall\\r\\n 12px|Wolfson College Crest Wolfson\\r\\n\\r\\n Schools, faculties and departments \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\\r\\nthumb|Old Schools (left) houses the university\\'s administrative offices\\r\\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions. Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master\\'s degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:\\r\\n\\r\\n Arts and Humanities\\r\\n Biological Sciences\\r\\n Clinical Medicine\\r\\n Humanities and Social Sciences\\r\\n Physical Sciences\\r\\n Technology\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university\\'s operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions.

In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted. In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university\\'s standard offer for most courses is set at A*AA, with A*A*A for science courses, or equivalent in other examination systems, e.g. 7,6,6 or 7,7,6 in IB. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity. For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.Oxbridge \\'over-recruits from eight schools\\'  BBC\\r\\n\\r\\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations, which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test. The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nGraduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department responsible for the applicant\\'s respective academic subject. An offer of acceptance effectively guarantees admission to the university, though not necessarily the applicant\\'s preferred choice of college.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter pool\\r\\nThe Winter Pool or inter-College Pool is part of the undergraduate application process intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered admission. Approximately 20–25% of undergraduate admissions are awarded through the Pool. Each college can place applicants in the Winter Pool. These applicants\\' applications are then considered by Admissions Tutors or Directors of Studies during the pool, which takes place over three days in January prior to the release of the university\\'s admissions decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each subject, colleges create an ordered list of the pooled applicants they seek to admit, and take turns choosing applicants. Colleges with specific student requirements, such as mature colleges and women-only colleges, are given priority over applicants eligible for their colleges. Some applicants are selected from the pool by the college that originally pooled them. Once all the colleges have selected as many applicants as they need, the pool ends. Some applicants are then interviewed a second time by the colleges before final admissions decisions are made.\\r\\n\\r\\nColleges can pool any candidate, either because the college has no space but believes the applicant is strong enough to get a place, or because the college wants to compare that applicant to other pooled applicants. Most applicants in the pool are pooled at their original college\\'s discretion, but some candidates meet the compulsory pooling criteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants. Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\n+Compulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidatesQualification TypeMinimum gradesNotesA-LevelsA*A*A*For science applicants, at least three A*s must be in science/maths subjectsInternational Baccalaureate43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\\r\\n42 points overall with 777 at higher levelFor science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjectsScottish Advanced HighersA1A1A1For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\\r\\nAs of 2012, there is only one specifically identified category for pooled applicants, which is known as S, meaning that the application is in special need of reassessment. This is used when candidates whose initial interview scores are of questionable accuracy, such as when a candidate received very different scores from different interviewers, experienced technical issues with interviews conducted over the internet, or was impacted by significant extenuating circumstances such as illness or the loss of a family member.\\r\\n\\r\\nPooled applicants who are fished by a college may be offered a place immediately or may be invited for an interview. In 2020, just 89 applicants were invited for second interviews, 34 of whom received offers of admission.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess\\r\\nthumb|Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford\\r\\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students). \\r\\n\\r\\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge\\'s collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance. Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering. The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university\\'s 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools. Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, is among those universities that have adopted formulae that rates the GCSE performance of every school in the country to weigh the scores of university applicants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the release of admissions figures, The Guardian reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables. A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process. Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge, six of them admitted fewer than 10 Black or mixed race students between 2012 and 2016.Cambridge University\\'s poor diversity record highlighted by report  The Guardian Similar criticism exists over a relatively lower admission rate for white working class applicants; in 2019, only 2% of admitted students were white working class.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students. While the usual entry requirements are A*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB. If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university. Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.\\r\\n\\r\\n Teaching \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Results for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are read aloud at Senate House and then tossed from the balcony in accordance with a tradition that began in the 18th century.\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university. Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; the Lent term last from January to March; and the Easter term last from April to June.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin these terms, undergraduate teaching takes place during eight-week periods called full terms. According to university statutes, it is a requirement during these periods that all students live within three miles of the Church of St Mary the Great, which this is known as keeping term. Students eligible for graduation must fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when pursuing a Master of Science, engineering, or mathematics degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities. Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter,  and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tripos exam involves a mixture of lectures organised by the university department) and supervised and organised by the colleges. Science subjects involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students, usually between one and three students, who meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of this supervision, which they then discuss with the supervisor during the session. The assignment is often an essay on a subject assigned by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students sometimes receive between one and four supervisory sessions each week. This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford, where supervisions are known as tutorials, and Cambridge and is sometimes credited with the exceptional nature generally associated with the education at these two world-renowned universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students\\' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.\\r\\n\\r\\n Research \\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues. From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\\r\\n\\r\\n Graduation tradition and ceremony\\r\\nthumb|Graduands enter Senate House at a graduation ceremony\\r\\nthumb|University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor\\'s deputy into Senate House for graduation\\r\\nThe university\\'s governing body Regent House manages and votes on graduations. A formal meeting of Regent House, known as a congregation, is held for this purpose, which is typically the final act during which all university procedures for undergraduate and graduate students and other degrees are finalized. After degrees are approved, candidates for graduation are required to request their respective college presents them during commencement congregation.\\r\\n\\r\\nGraduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress to which they are entitled prior to graduating; for example, most students becoming Bachelor of Arts graduates wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a post-graduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree was from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive. The BA gown without the strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or younger, and the MA gown without strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or older. Graduates are presented their degrees in Senate House by each respective college in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the university\\'s royal colleges.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the University of Cambridge\\'s congregation ceremony, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their respective college, who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor to receive the degree they have earned. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting \"____\" with the name of the degree and substituting \"woman\" for \"man\" if the graduate is female:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Latin statement translates in English as, \"Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\", which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of ____, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor\\'s door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n Libraries and museums \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Trinity College\\'s Wren Library\\r\\nthumb|Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge has 116 libraries. Cambridge University Library, which holds over eight million volumes, is the central research library. It is a legal deposit library, which entitles it to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty\\'s Seeley Historical Library houses in excess of 100,000 books. Every college also maintains a library, partly for the purpose of undergraduate teaching; older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College\\'s Wren Library houses over 200,000 books printed before 1800 and Corpus Christi College\\'s Parker Library has over 600 medieval manuscripts, representing one of the largest such collections in the world. Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College houses the official papers of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanical garden. Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum; Kettle\\'s Yard is the university\\'s contemporary art gallery; the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university\\'s collections of local antiquities along with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world; Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside the museum. Cambridge University Museum of Zoology also holds specimens collected by Charles Darwin, an 1831 University of Cambridge alumnus. Other museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university\\'s geology museum, which displays some of Darwin\\'s geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university\\'s botanical garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n Publishing and assessments \\r\\n\\r\\nThe university\\'s publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.  It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students. It also issues some awards to those of varying global academic accomplishment regardless of whether their recipient is affiliated with the University of Cambridge. Some of these awards and prizes rank among the world\\'s most estimable academic and intellectual accomplishments.

An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n Student life \\r\\n\\r\\n Formal halls and May balls \\r\\nthumb|The bridge over the River Cam at Clare College during the 2005 May Ball in Cambridge\\r\\nthumb|The University Centre main dining hall\\r\\nOne privilege of student life at the University of Cambridge is the opportunity to attend formal dinners at a student\\'s respective college, known as Formal Hall that are held regularly during academic terms and daily at some of the university\\'s colleges. During Formal Hall, students typically sit down for a meal in their gowns while fellows and sometimes guests eat separately at a so-called High Table. The beginning and end of the function is usually marked with grace, which is said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nJCR and MCR\\r\\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students\\' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocieties\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world\\'s oldest continuing running debate society\\r\\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests. , there were 751 registered societies at the university. In addition to these, individual colleges often promote their own societies and sports teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough technically independent from the university, Cambridge Union, a globally-renowned debate organization and the oldest debate organization in the world, offers students high-level debate and public speaking experience. Drama societies include the Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC) and the comedy club Footlights, whose alumni include many well-known show business personalities. The university\\'s Chamber Orchestra, composed entirely of university students, offers a range of orchestra programs, including symphonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSports\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The boathouse of the Cambridge University Boat Club\\r\\nRowing is one of the most popular sports at the University of Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges, notably the bumps races. The University of Cambridge\\'s rowing competition against Oxford is known as Boat Race. Varsity matches against Oxford also exist in other sports, including cricket, rugby, chess, and tiddlywinks. Athletes representing the university in certain sports are entitled to apply to Cambridge Blue, which includes captains of the 13 most prestigious university sports teams. University organizations also include the self-described Hawks\\' Club, which is open to men and usually restricted to Cambridge Full Blues and Half Blues members. The Ospreys are the equivalent female club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Cambridge Sports Centre opened in August 2013. Phase one included a sports hall, a fitness suite, a strength and conditioning room, a multi-purpose room, and Eton and Rugby fives courts.

CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students\\' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers. In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students\\' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE\\'s history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students\\' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university\\'s catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service. After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\n Notable alumni and academics \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of a history now exceeding 800 years, a number of University of Cambridge alumni and faculty have emerged as trailblazing thought leaders, innovators, and historical icons in their respective fields.

It is the county town and only city of Oxfordshire. It had a population of 162,100 at the 2021 census. It is  north-west of London,  south-east of Birmingham and  north-east of Bristol. The city is home to the University of Oxford, the oldest university in the English-speaking world;. it has buildings in every style of English architecture since late Anglo-Saxon. Oxford\\'s industries include motor manufacturing, education, publishing, information technology and science.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|19th-century view of the High Street in Oxford\\r\\nThe history of Oxford in England dates back to its original settlement in the Saxon period. Originally of strategic significance due to its controlling location on the upper reaches of the River Thames at its junction with the River Cherwell, the town grew in national importance during the early Norman period, and in the late 12th century became home to the fledgling University of Oxford. The city was besieged during The Anarchy in 1142.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university rose to dominate the town. A heavily ecclesiastical town, Oxford was greatly affected by the changes of the English Reformation, emerging as the seat of a bishopric and a full-fledged city. During the English Civil War, Oxford housed the court of Charles I and stood at the heart of national affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city began to grow industrially during the 19th century, and had an industrial boom in the early 20th century, with major printing and car-manufacturing industries. These declined, along with other British heavy industry, in the 1970s and 1980s, leaving behind a city which had developed far beyond the university town of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeography\\r\\n Physical \\r\\nLocation\\r\\nOxford\\'s latitude and longitude are  and its Ordnance Survey grid reference is  (at Carfax Tower, which is usually considered the centre). Oxford is  north-west of Reading,  north-east of Swindon,  east of Cheltenham,  east of Gloucester,  south-west of Milton Keynes,  south-east of Evesham,  south of Rugby and  west-north-west of London. The rivers Cherwell and Thames (also sometimes known as the Isis locally, supposedly from the Latinised name ) run through Oxford and meet south of the city centre. These rivers and their flood plains constrain the size of the city centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate\\r\\nOxford has a maritime temperate climate (Köppen: Cfb). Precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year and is provided mostly by weather systems that arrive from the Atlantic. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Oxford was  on 24 December 1860. The highest temperature ever recorded in Oxford is  on 19 July 2022. The average conditions below are from the Radcliffe Meteorological Station. It boasts the longest series of temperature and rainfall records for one site in Britain. These records are continuous from January 1815. Irregular observations of rainfall, cloud and temperature exist from 1767.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driest year on record was 1788, with  of rainfall. The wettest year was 2012, with . The wettest month on record was September 1774, with a total fall of . The warmest month on record is July 1983, with an average of  and the coldest is January 1963, with an average of . The warmest year on record is 2014, with an average of  and the coldest is 1879, with a mean temperature of . The sunniest month on record is May 2020, with 331.7 hours and December 1890 is the least sunny, with 5.0 hours. The greatest one-day rainfall occurred on 10 July 1968, with a total of . The greatest known snow depth was  in February 1888.\\r\\n\\r\\nMap of Oxford|thumb|upright=2.25\\r\\n\\r\\n Districts \\r\\n\\r\\n The city centre \\r\\n\\r\\nThe city centre is relatively small, and is centred on Carfax, a crossroads which forms the junction of Cornmarket Street (pedestrianised), Queen Street (mainly pedestrianised), St Aldate\\'s and the High Street (\"the High\"; blocked for through traffic). Cornmarket Street and Queen Street are home to Oxford\\'s chain stores, as well as a small number of independent retailers, one of the longest established of which was Boswell\\'s, founded in 1738. The store closed in 2020. St Aldate\\'s has few shops but several local government buildings, including the town hall, the city police station and local council offices. The High (the word street is traditionally omitted) is the longest of the four streets and has a number of independent and high-end chain stores, but mostly university and college buildings. The historic buildings mean the area is regularly used by film and TV crews.\\r\\n\\r\\n Suburbs \\r\\nAside from the city centre, there are several suburbs and neighbourhoods within the borders of the city of Oxford, including:\\r\\n\\r\\n Barton\\r\\n Blackbird Leys\\r\\n Cowley\\r\\n Temple Cowley\\r\\n Iffley\\r\\n Littlemore\\r\\n Rose Hill\\r\\n Cutteslowe\\r\\n Headington\\r\\n New Marston\\r\\n Jericho\\r\\n North Oxford\\r\\n Park Town\\r\\n Norham Manor\\r\\n Walton Manor\\r\\n Osney\\r\\n Risinghurst\\r\\n Summertown\\r\\n Sunnymead\\r\\n Waterways\\r\\n Wolvercote\\r\\n\\r\\n Green belt \\r\\n\\r\\nright|thumb|Oxford Malmaison Hotel\\r\\nOxford is at the centre of the Oxford Green Belt, which is an environmental and planning policy that regulates the rural space in Oxfordshire surrounding the city, aiming to prevent urban sprawl and minimize convergence with nearby settlements. The policy has been blamed for the large rise in house prices in Oxford, making it the least affordable city in the United Kingdom outside of London, with estate agents calling for brownfield land inside the green belt to be released for new housing. The vast majority of the area covered is outside of the city, but there are some green spaces within that which are covered by the designation, such as much of the Thames and river Cherwell flood-meadows, and the village of Binsey, along with several smaller portions on the fringes. Other landscape features and places of interest covered include Cutteslowe Park and the mini railway attraction, the University Parks, Hogacre Common Eco Park, numerous sports grounds, Aston\\'s Eyot, St Margaret\\'s Church and well, and Wolvercote Common and community orchard.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernance\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Town Hall, St Aldate\\'s\\r\\nThere are two tiers of local government covering Oxford, at district and county level: Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire County Council. From 1889 to 1974 the city of Oxford was a county borough, independent from the county council. Oxford City Council meets at the Town Hall on the street called St Aldate\\'s in the city centre. The current building was completed in 1897, on a site which had been occupied by Oxford\\'s guildhall since the 13th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of Oxford is an unparished area, but there are four civil parishes within the city\\'s boundaries: Blackbird Leys, Littlemore, Old Marston, and Risinghurst and Sandhills.\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomy\\r\\nOxford\\'s economy includes manufacturing, publishing and science-based industries as well as education, sports, entertainment, breweries, research and tourism.\\r\\n\\r\\nCar production\\r\\nOxford has been an important centre of motor manufacturing since Morris Motors was established in the city in 1910. The principal production site for Mini cars, owned by BMW since 2000, is in the Oxford suburb of Cowley. The plant, which survived the turbulent years of British Leyland in the 1970s and was threatened with closure in the early 1990s, also produced cars under the Austin and Rover brands following the demise of the Morris brand in 1984, although the last Morris-badged car was produced there in 1982.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublishing\\r\\nOxford University Press, a department of the University of Oxford, is based in the city, although it no longer operates its own paper mill and printing house. The city is also home to the UK operations of Wiley-Blackwell, Elsevier and several smaller publishing houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience and technology\\r\\nThe presence of the university has given rise to many science and technology based businesses, including Oxford Instruments, Research Machines and Sophos. The university established Isis Innovation in 1987 to promote technology transfer. The Oxford Science Park was established in 1990, and the Begbroke Science Park, owned by the university, lies north of the city. Oxford increasingly has a reputation for being a centre of digital innovation, as epitomized by Digital Oxford. Several startups including Passle, Brainomix, Labstep, and more, are based in Oxford.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nright|thumb|The Divinity School at the Bodleian Library\\r\\nthumb|right|Wellington Square, the name of which has become synonymous with the university\\'s central administration\\r\\nThe presence of the university has also led to Oxford becoming a centre for the education industry. Companies often draw their teaching staff from the pool of Oxford University students and graduates, and, especially for EFL education, use their Oxford location as a selling point.\\r\\n\\r\\n Tourism \\r\\nright|thumb|The University Church of St Mary the Virgin\\r\\nright|thumb|Carfax Tower at Carfax, the junction of the High Street, Queen Street, Cornmarket and St Aldate\\'s streets at what is considered by many to be the centre of the city\\r\\nOxford has numerous major tourist attractions, many belonging to the university and colleges. As well as several famous institutions, the town centre is home to Carfax Tower and the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, both of which offer views over the spires of the city. Many tourists shop at the historic Covered Market. In the summer, punting on the Thames/Isis and the Cherwell is a common practice. As well as being a major draw for tourists (9.1\\xa0million in 2008, similar in 2009), Oxford city centre has many shops, several theatres and an ice rink.\\r\\n\\r\\n Retail \\r\\nright|thumb|Night view of High Street with Christmas lights – one of Oxford\\'s main streets\\r\\nThere are two small shopping malls in the city centre: the Clarendon Centre and the Westgate Centre. The Westgate Centre is named for the original West Gate in the city wall, and is at the west end of Queen Street. A major redevelopment and expansion to , with a new  John Lewis department store and a number of new homes, was completed in October 2017. Blackwell\\'s Bookshop is a bookshop which claims the largest single room devoted to book sales in the whole of Europe, the Norrington Room (10,000 sq ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nBrewing\\r\\nThere is a long history of brewing in Oxford. Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, at Brasenose, survived until 1889. In the 16th century brewing and malting appear to have been the most popular trades in the city. There were breweries in Brewer Street and Paradise Street, near the Castle Mill Stream. The rapid expansion of Oxford and the development of its railway links after the 1840s facilitated expansion of the brewing trade. As well as expanding the market for Oxford\\'s brewers, railways enabled brewers further from the city to compete for a share of its market. By 1874 there were nine breweries in Oxford and 13 brewers\\' agents in Oxford shipping beer in from elsewhere. The nine breweries were: Flowers & Co in Cowley Road, Hall\\'s St Giles Brewery, Hall\\'s Swan Brewery (see below), Hanley\\'s City Brewery in Queen Street, Le Mills\\'s Brewery in St. Ebbes, Morrell\\'s Lion Brewery in St Thomas Street (see below), Simonds\\'s Brewery in Queen Street, Weaving\\'s Eagle Brewery (by 1869 the Eagle Steam Brewery) in Park End Street and Wootten and Cole\\'s St. Clement\\'s Brewery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swan\\'s Nest Brewery, later the Swan Brewery, was established by the early 18th century in Paradise Street, and in 1795 was acquired by William Hall. The brewery became known as Hall\\'s Oxford Brewery, which acquired other local breweries. Hall\\'s Brewery was acquired by Samuel Allsopp & Sons in 1926, after which it ceased brewing in Oxford. Morrell\\'s was founded in 1743 by Richard Tawney. He formed a partnership in 1782 with Mark and James Morrell, who eventually became the owners. After an acrimonious family dispute this much-loved brewery was closed in 1998, the beer brand names being taken over by the Thomas Hardy Burtonwood brewery, while the 132 tied pubs were bought by Michael Cannon, owner of the American hamburger chain Fuddruckers, through a new company, Morrells of Oxford. The new owners sold most of the pubs on to Greene King in 2002. The Lion Brewery was converted into luxury apartments in 2002. Oxford\\'s first legal distillery, the Oxford Artisan Distillery, was established in 2017 in historic farm buildings at the top of South Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nBellfounding\\r\\nThe Taylor family of Loughborough had a bell-foundry in Oxford between 1786 and 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuildings\\r\\nright|thumb|Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford\\r\\nright|thumb|Oxford Botanic Garden\\r\\nThis is a small selection of the many notable buildings in Oxford.\\r\\n\\r\\n Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford\\r\\n The Headington Shark\\r\\n Oxford University Press\\r\\n Oxford Botanic Garden\\r\\n Sheldonian Theatre\\r\\n St. Mary the Virgin Church\\r\\n Radcliffe Camera\\r\\n Radcliffe Observatory\\r\\n Oxford Oratory\\r\\n Malmaison Hotel, in a converted prison in part of the medieval Oxford Castle\\r\\n\\r\\nParks and nature walks\\r\\nOxford is a very green city, with several parks and nature walks within the ring road, as well as several sites just outside the ring road.

The airport is also home to CAE Oxford Aviation Academy and Airways Aviation airline pilot flight training centres, and several private jet companies. The airport is also home to Airbus Helicopters UK headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nRail–airport links\\r\\nDirect trains run from Oxford station to  where there is an interchange with the Heathrow Express train links serving Heathrow Airport. Passengers can change at Reading for connecting trains to Gatwick Airport. Some CrossCountry trains run direct services to Birmingham International, as well as to Southampton Airport Parkway further afield.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuses\\r\\nalt=|thumb|Oxford Bus Company hybrid bus on a park & ride service\\r\\nthumb|Oxford Bus Company flywheel energy storage bus on a BrookesBus service\\r\\n\\r\\nBus services in Oxford and its suburbs are run by the Oxford Bus Company and Stagecoach West as well as other operators including Arriva Shires & Essex and Thames Travel. Oxford has one of the largest urban park and ride networks in the United Kingdom. Its five sites, at Pear Tree, Redbridge, Seacourt, Thornhill, Water Eaton and Oxford Parkway have a combined capacity of 4,930 car parking spaces, served by 20 Oxford Bus Company double decker buses with a combined capacity of 1,695 seats. Hybrid buses began to be used in Oxford in 2010, and their usage has been expanded. In 2014 Oxford Bus introduced a fleet of 20 new buses with flywheel energy storage on the services it operates under contract for Oxford Brookes University. Most buses in the city now use a smartcard to pay for journeys and have free WiFi installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoach\\r\\nThe Oxford to London coach route offers a frequent coach service to London. The Oxford Tube is operated by Stagecoach West and the Oxford Bus Company runs the Airline services to Heathrow and Gatwick airports. There is a bus station at Gloucester Green, used mainly by the London and airport buses, National Express  coaches and other long-distance buses including route X5 to Milton Keynes and Cambridge and Stagecoach Gold route S6.\\r\\n\\r\\nCycling\\r\\nAmong British cities, Oxford has the second highest percentage of people cycling to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nRail\\r\\nalt=|thumb|Oxford railway station, in the city centre\\r\\nalt=|thumb|Oxford Parkway Station, on the outskirts near Kidlington\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford railway station is half a mile (about 1\\xa0km) west of the city centre. The station is served by CrossCountry services to Bournemouth and Manchester Piccadilly; Great Western Railway (who manage the station) services to London Paddington, Banbury and Hereford; and Chiltern Railways services to London Marylebone. Oxford has had three main railway stations. The first was opened at Grandpont in 1844, but this was a terminus, inconvenient for routes to the north; it was replaced by the present station on Park End Street in 1852 with the opening of the Birmingham route. Another terminus, at Rewley Road, was opened in 1851 to serve the Bletchley route; this station closed in 1951. There have also been a number of local railway stations, all of which are now closed.  A fourth station, , is just outside the city, at the park and ride site near Kidlington. The present railway station opened in 1852.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford is the junction for a short branch line to Bicester, a remnant of the former Varsity line to Cambridge. This Oxford–Bicester line was upgraded to  running during an 18-month closure in 2014/2015 – and is scheduled to be extended to form the planned East West Rail line to Milton Keynes. East West Rail is proposed to continue through  (for ) to Bedford, Cambridge, and ultimately Ipswich and Norwich, thus providing alternative route to East Anglia without needing to travel via, and connect between, the London mainline terminals.\\r\\n\\r\\nChiltern Railways operates from Oxford to London Marylebone via , having sponsored the building of about 400 metres of new track between Bicester Village and the Chiltern Main Line southwards in 2014. The route serves High Wycombe and London Marylebone, avoiding London Paddington and Didcot Parkway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1844, the Great Western Railway linked Oxford with London Paddington via  and ; in 1851, the London & North Western Railway opened its own route from Oxford to London Euston, via Bicester,  and Watford; and in 1864 a third route, also to Paddington, running via ,  and , was provided; this was shortened in 1906 by the opening of a direct route between High Wycombe and London Paddington by way of . The distance from Oxford to London was  via Bletchley;  via Didcot and Reading;  via Thame and Maidenhead; and  via Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the original () route is still in use for its full length, portions of the others remain. There were also routes to the north and west. The line to  was opened in 1850, and was extended to Birmingham Snow Hill in 1852; a route to Worcester opened in 1853. A branch to Witney was opened in 1862, which was extended to  in 1873. The line to Witney and Fairford closed in 1962, but the others remain open.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiver and canal\\r\\nOxford was historically an important port on the River Thames, with this section of the river being called the Isis; the Oxford-Burcot Commission in the 17th century attempted to improve navigation to Oxford. Iffley Lock and Osney Lock lie within the bounds of the city. In the 18th century the Oxford Canal was built to connect Oxford with the Midlands. Commercial traffic has given way to recreational use of the river and canal. Oxford was the original base of Salters Steamers (founded in 1858), which was a leading racing-boatbuilder that played an important role in popularising pleasure boating on the Upper Thames. The firm runs a regular service from Folly Bridge downstream to Abingdon and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoads\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The M40 extension\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford\\'s central location on several transport routes means that it has long been a crossroads city with many coaching inns, although road traffic is now strongly discouraged, and largely prevented, from using the city centre. The Oxford Ring Road or A4142 (southern part) surrounds the city centre and close suburbs Marston, Iffley, Cowley and Headington; it consists of the A34 to the west, a 330-yard section of the A44, the A40 north and north-east, A4142/A423 to the east. It is a dual carriageway, except for a 330-yard section of the A40 where two residential service roads adjoin, and was completed in 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nA roads\\r\\nThe main roads to/from Oxford are:\\r\\n A34 – a trunk route connecting the North and Midlands to the port of Southampton. It leaves J9 of the M40 north of Oxford, passes west of Oxford to Newbury and Winchester to the south and joins the M3  north of Southampton. Since the completion of the Newbury bypass in 1998, this section of the A34 has been an entirely grade separated dual carriageway. Historically the A34 led to Bicester, Banbury, Stratford-upon-Avon, Birmingham and Manchester, but since the completion of the M40 it disappears at J9 and re-emerges  north at Solihull.\\r\\n A40 – leading east dualled to J8 of the M40 motorway, then an alternative route to High Wycombe and London; leading west part-dualled to Witney then bisecting Cheltenham, Gloucester, Monmouth, Abergavenny, passing Brecon, Llandovery, Carmarthen and Haverfordwest to reach Fishguard.\\r\\n A44 – which begins in Oxford, leading past Evesham to Worcester, Hereford and Aberystwyth.\\r\\n A420 – which also begins in Oxford and leads to Bristol, passing Swindon and Chippenham.\\r\\n\\r\\nZero Emission Zone\\r\\nOn 28 February 2022 a zero-emission pilot area became operational in Oxford City Centre. Zero emission vehicles can be used without incurring a charge but all petrol and diesel vehicles (including hybrids) incur a daily charge if they are driven in the zone between 7am and 7pm.\\r\\n\\r\\nA consultation on the introduction of a wider Zero Emission Zone is expected in the future, at a date to be confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBus gates\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford has eight bus gates, short sections of road where only buses and other authorised vehicles can pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix further bus gates are currently proposed. A council-led consultation on the traffic filters ended on 13 October 2022. In a decision made on 29 November 2022, Oxfordshire County Council cabinet approved the introduction on a trial basis, for a minimum period of six months. The trial will begin after improvement works to Oxford railway station are complete, which is expected to be by Christmas 2023. The additional bus gates have been controversial; Oxford University and Oxford Bus Company support the proposals but more than 3,700 people have signed an online petition opposing the new traffic filters for Marston Ferry Road and Hollow Way, and hotelier Jeremy Mogford has argued they would be a mistake. In November 2022, Mogford announced that his hospitality group The Oxford Collection had joined up with Oxford Business Action Group (OBAG), Oxford High Street Association (OHSA), ROX (Backing Oxford Business), Reconnecting Oxford, Jericho Traders, and Summertown traders to launch a legal challenge to the new bus gates.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotorway\\r\\nThe city is served by the M40 motorway, which connects London to Birmingham. The M40 approached Oxford in 1974, leading from London to Waterstock, where the A40 continued to Oxford. When the M40 extension to Birmingham was completed in January 1991, it curved sharply north, and a mile of the old motorway became a spur. The M40 comes no closer than  away from the city centre, curving to pass to the east of Otmoor. The M40 meets the A34 to the north of Oxford.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nSchools\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversities and colleges\\r\\n\\r\\nright|thumb|Sheldonian Theatre in 2009\\r\\nThere are two universities in Oxford, the University of Oxford and Oxford Brookes University, as well as the specialist further and higher education institution Ruskin College that is an Affiliate of the University of Oxford. The Islamic Azad University also has a campus near Oxford. The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and one of the most prestigious higher education institutions of the world, averaging nine applications to every available place, and attracting 40% of its academic staff and 17% of undergraduates from overseas. In September 2016, it was ranked as the world\\'s number one university, according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Oxford is renowned for its tutorial-based method of teaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bodleian Library\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Oxford maintains the largest university library system in the United Kingdom, and, with over 11\\xa0million volumes housed on  of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the United Kingdom, after the British Library. The Bodleian Library is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the United Kingdom. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedia\\r\\nAs well as the BBC national radio stations, Oxford and the surrounding area has several local stations, including BBC Radio Oxford, Heart South, Destiny 105, Jack FM, Jack 2 Hits and Jack 3 & Chill, along with Oxide: Oxford Student Radio (which went on terrestrial radio at 87.7\\xa0MHz FM in late May 2005). A local TV station, Six TV: The Oxford Channel, was also available but closed in April 2009; a service operated by That\\'s TV, originally called That\\'s Oxford (now That\\'s Oxfordshire), took to the airwaves in 2015. The city is home to a BBC Television newsroom which produces an opt-out from the main South Today programme broadcast from Southampton.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal papers include The Oxford Times (compact; weekly), its sister papers the Oxford Mail (tabloid; daily) and the Oxford Star (tabloid; free and delivered), and Oxford Journal (tabloid; weekly free pick-up). Oxford is also home to several advertising agencies. Daily Information (known locally as Daily Info) is an events and advertising news sheet which has been published since 1964 and now provides a connected website. Nightshift is a monthly local free magazine that has covered the Oxford music scene since 1991.\"Preview: Nightshift night \", \"Oxford Mail\", 6 July 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture\\r\\n Museums and galleries \\r\\n\\r\\nOxford is home to many museums, galleries, and collections, most of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions. The majority are departments of the University of Oxford. The first of these to be established was the Ashmolean Museum, the world\\'s first university museum,MacGregor, A. (2001). The Ashmolean Museum. A brief history of the museum and its collections. Ashmolean Museum & Jonathan Horne Publications, London. and the oldest museum in the UK. Its first building was erected in 1678–1683 to house a cabinet of curiosities given to the University of Oxford in 1677. The museum reopened in 2009 after a major redevelopment. It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university\\'s zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university\\'s Science Area. Among its collection are the skeletons of a Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy. Adjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university\\'s archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world\\'s oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building. It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the university\\'s Faculty of Music on St Aldate\\'s is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a collection of over 200 old master paintings. The university also has an archive at the Oxford University Press Museum. Other museums and galleries in Oxford include Modern Art Oxford, the Museum of Oxford, the Oxford Castle, Science Oxford and The Story Museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt\\r\\nArt galleries in Oxford include the Ashmolean Museum, the Christ Church Picture Gallery, and Modern Art Oxford. William Turner (aka \"Turner of Oxford\", 1789–1862), was a watercolourist who painted landscapes in the Oxford area. The Oxford Art Society was established in 1891. The later watercolourist and draughtsman Ken Messer (1931–2018) has been dubbed \"The Oxford Artist\" by some, with his architectural paintings around the city. In 2018, The Oxford Art Book featured many contemporary local artists and their depictions of Oxford scenes. The annual Oxfordshire Artweeks is well-represented by artists in Oxford itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic\\r\\nHolywell Music Room is said to be the oldest purpose-built music room in Europe, and hence Britain\\'s first concert hall. Tradition has it that George Frideric Handel performed there, though there is little evidence. Joseph Haydn was awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University in 1791, an event commemorated by three concerts of his music at the Sheldonian Theatre, directed by the composer and from which his Symphony No. 92 earned the nickname of the \"Oxford\" Symphony. Victorian composer Sir John Stainer was organist at Magdalen College and later Professor of Music at the university, and is buried in Holywell Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford, and its surrounding towns and villages, have produced many successful bands and musicians in the field of popular music. The most notable Oxford act is Radiohead, who all met at nearby Abingdon School, though other well known local bands include Supergrass, Ride, Mr Big, Swervedriver, Lab 4, Talulah Gosh, the Candyskins, Medal, the Egg, Unbelievable Truth, Hurricane No. 1, Crackout, Goldrush and more recently, Young Knives, Foals, Glass Animals, Dive Dive and Stornoway. These and many other bands from over 30 years of the Oxford music scene\\'s history feature in the documentary film Anyone Can Play Guitar?. In 1997, Oxford played host to Radio 1\\'s Sound City, with acts such as Travis, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Embrace, Spiritualized and DJ Shadow playing in various venues around the city including Oxford Brookes University. It is also home to several brass bands, notably the City of Oxford Silver Band, founded in 1887.\\r\\n\\r\\n Theatres and cinemas \\r\\n\\r\\n Burton Taylor Studio, Gloucester Street\\r\\n New Theatre, George Street\\r\\n Odeon Cinema, George Street\\r\\n Odeon Cinema, Magdalen Street\\r\\n Curzon Cinema, Westgate, Bonn Square\\r\\n Old Fire Station Theatre, George Street\\r\\n O\\'Reilly Theatre, Blackhall Road\\r\\n Oxford Playhouse, Beaumont Street\\r\\n Pegasus Theatre,Pegasus Theatre , UK.

They were elected to the Football League in 1962, reached the Third Division after three years and the Second Division after six, and most notably reached the First Division in 1985 – 23 years after joining the Football League. They spent three seasons in the top flight, winning the Football League Cup a year after promotion. The 18 years that followed relegation in 1988 saw their fortunes decline gradually, though a brief respite in 1996 saw them win promotion to the new (post Premier League) Division One in 1996 and stay there for three years. They were relegated to the Football Conference in 2006, staying there for four seasons before returning to the Football League in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey play at the Kassam Stadium (named after former chairman Firoz Kassam), which is near the Blackbird Leys housing estate and has been their home since relocation from the Manor Ground in 2001. The club\\'s notable former managers include Ian Greaves, Jim Smith, Maurice Evans, Brian Horton, Ramon Diaz and Denis Smith. Notable former players include John Aldridge, Ray Houghton, Tommy Caton, Matt Elliott, Dean Saunders and Dean Whitehead. Oxford City F.C. is a semi-professional football club, separate from Oxford United, they play in the National League, the fifth tier, one level below the Football League in the pyramid.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world\\'s second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as Oxbridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college. It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world\\'s oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide. In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.78\\xa0billion, of which £711.4\\xa0million was from research grants and contracts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.  73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals. Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n History \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Aerial view of Merton College\\'s Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\\r\\nthumb|In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\\r\\n\\r\\n Founding \\r\\nthumb|Balliol College, one of the university\\'s oldest constituent colleges\\r\\nThe University of Oxford\\'s foundation date is unknown. It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being. The scholar  Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris. The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a universitas or corporation in 1231. The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two \\'nations\\', representing the North (northerners or Boreales, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (southerners or Australes, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).H. Rashdall, Universities of Europe, iii, 55–60. In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students\\' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.Christopher Brooke, Roger Highfield. Oxford and Cambridge. At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College, and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name. Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;Edward France Percival. The Foundation Statutes of Merton College, Oxford. Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford, as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.Daniel J. Boorstin. (1958.) The Americans; the Colonial Experience, Vintage, pp. 171–184 .Christopher Nugent Lawrence Brooke. (1988.) Oxford and Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 56.\\r\\n\\r\\n Renaissance period \\r\\nthumb|An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\\r\\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies, and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford\\'s reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1636, William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university\\'s statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause. From the mid-18th century onwards, however, the university took little part in political conflicts.\\r\\nalt=Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College|thumb|Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\\r\\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\\r\\n\\r\\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle\\'s \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college\\'s Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.\\r\\n\\r\\n Modern period \\r\\n Students \\r\\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\" Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).William D. Rubinstein, \"The social origins and career patterns of Oxford and Cambridge matriculants, 1840–1900.\" Historical Research 82.218 (2009): 715–730, data on pages 719 and 724.For more details see Mark C. Curthoys, \"Origins and Destinations: the social mobility of Oxford men and women\" in Michael G. Brock and Mark C. Curthoys, eds. The History of the University of Oxford Volume 7: Nineteenth-Century (2000) part 2, pp 571–95.\\r\\n\\r\\nM.\\xa0C. Curthoys and H.\\xa0S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total. The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed. Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, \\'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918\\'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.\\r\\n\\r\\n Reforms \\r\\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission\\'s report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores. Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853. By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school. In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. The influence of the reformed model of German universities reached Oxford via key scholars such as Edward Bouverie Pusey, Benjamin Jowett and Max Müller.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women\\'s colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges\\' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university\\'s emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mid-20th century saw many distinguished continental scholars, displaced by Nazism and communism, relocating to Oxford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.\\r\\n\\r\\n Women\\'s education \\r\\n\\r\\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level; for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive ad eundem degrees from the University of Dublin. In June 1878, the Association for the Education of Women (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot\\'s group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.Alden\\'s Oxford Guide. Oxford: Alden & Co., 1958; pp. 120–21 Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker\\'s shop. There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne\\'s College.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh\\'s (1886) and St Hilda\\'s (1893). All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne\\'s in 1979, and finishing with St Hilda\\'s, which began to accept male students in 2008. In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege, however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women\\'s examinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees. In 1927 the university\\'s dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957. However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women\\'s colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women\\'s colleges were given full collegiate status.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine\\'s became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women. The majority of men\\'s colleges accepted their first female students in 1979, with Christ Church following in 1980, and Oriel becoming the last men\\'s college to admit women in 1985. Most of Oxford\\'s graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony\\'s, which was founded as a men\\'s college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962. By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female; in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford. That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective novel Gaudy Night by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers\\' own Somerville CollegeSomerville Stories – Dorothy L Sayers , Somerville College, University of Oxford, UK.), and the issue of women\\'s education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson\\'s book Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.\\r\\n\\r\\n Buildings and sites \\r\\n\\r\\n Map \\r\\n\\r\\n Main sites \\r\\nthumb|Atrium of the Chemistry Research Laboratory; the university has invested heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\\r\\nthumb|Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university\\'s Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\\r\\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges\\' sites are of similar size to these areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400\\xa0m × 25\\xa0m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre. The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".\\r\\n\\r\\n Parks \\r\\nthumb|Summer in the Botanic Garden\\r\\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28\\xa0ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on . It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a  site  south of the city that includes native woodland and  of meadow. The  Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganisation \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a collegiate university, Oxford is structured as a federation, comprising over forty self-governing colleges and halls, along with a central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcademic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.\\r\\n\\r\\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).\\r\\n\\r\\n Central governance \\r\\nthumb|Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university\\'s central administration.\\r\\nThe university\\'s formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey, is the de facto head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by Congregation, in addition to observers from the students\\' union. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university\\'s academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university\\'s proceedings. The university\\'s professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university\\'s graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four divisions, each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Oxford is a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.\\r\\n\\r\\n Colleges \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Tom Quad, Christ Church\\r\\nthumb|Main Quad, Worcester College\\r\\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities. Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colleges are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\\r\\n Blackfriars Hall\\r\\n Campion Hall\\r\\n Regent\\'s Park College\\r\\n Wycliffe Hall\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university. The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. There is no common title for the heads of colleges: the titles used include Warden, Provost, Principal, President, Rector, Master and Dean.\\r\\n\\r\\n Finances \\r\\nthumb|Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\\r\\nIn 2017–18, the university had an income of £2,237m; key sources were research grants (£579.1m) and academic fees (£332.5m). The colleges had a total income of £492.9m.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over £6.4bn compared to the university\\'s £1.2bn. The central University\\'s endowment, along with some of the colleges\\', is managed by the university\\'s wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007. The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies. However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total assets of the colleges of £6.3\\xa0billion also exceed total university assets of £4.1\\xa0billion. The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\". This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure; having passed its original target of £1.25\\xa0billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3\\xa0billion. The campaign had raised a total of £2.8\\xa0billion by July 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n Funding criticisms \\r\\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710, and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902. In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal, and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019. The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015 and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father, Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.\\r\\n\\r\\n Affiliations \\r\\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.\\r\\n\\r\\n Academic profile \\r\\n Admission \\r\\n+ Undergraduate admission statistics  2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Applications23,81924,33823,41423,02021,515 Offer Rate (%)15.314.616.816.917.8 Enrols3,2713,2983,6953,2803,309 Yield (%)89.792.894.084.386.2 Applicant/Enrolled Ratio7.287.386.347.026.50 Average Entry Tariff205201200205\\r\\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)Domicile and EthnicityTotalBritish White British Ethnic Minorities International EU International Non-EU Undergraduate Widening Participation IndicatorsFemale Private Schools Low Participation Areas \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.25|Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge\\r\\n\\r\\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.  The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.\\r\\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools; for instance, Laura Spence\\'s rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate. In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools. However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects. The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%. Oxford University spends over £6\\xa0million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018 the university\\'s annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford\\'s colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years. Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\" In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels. The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%). UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching and degrees \\r\\n\\r\\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week\\'s work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity. (These are officially known as \\'Full Term\\': \\'Term\\' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term). Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities, and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch degrees at the master\\'s and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.\\r\\n\\r\\n Scholarships and financial support \\r\\nright|thumb|Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world\\'s most prestigious scholarship.\\r\\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships. Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities. The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards. In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network. The course available is called \\'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\n Libraries \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university\\'s own central administration.\\r\\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK, and, with over 11\\xa0million volumes housed on  of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe buildings referred to as the university\\'s main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602, the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together. It now comprises 28 libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library. Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System), and its public interface, SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.\\r\\nthumb|Duke Humfrey\\'s Library in the  Bodleian Library\\r\\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010, and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015. The renovation is designed to better showcase the library\\'s various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004. Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the Electronic Enlightenment Project, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.\\r\\n\\r\\n Museums \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\\r\\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world. It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university\\'s zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university\\'s Science Area. Among its collection are the skeletons of a Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.{\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university\\'s archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world\\'s oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building. It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate\\'s is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.\\r\\n\\r\\n Publishing \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford University Press is the world\\'s second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications. More than 6,000 new books are published annually, including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the Oxford English Dictionary, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, the Oxford World\\'s Classics, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and the Concise Dictionary of National Biography).\\r\\n\\r\\n Rankings and reputation \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.2|University of Oxford\\'s national league table performance over the past ten years\\r\\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, as well as the Forbes\\'s World University Rankings. It held the number one position in the Times Good University Guide for eleven consecutive years, and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for the past seven consecutive years. In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings. The THE has also recognised Oxford as one of the world\\'s \"six super brands\" on its World Reputation Rankings, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. The university is fifth worldwide on the US News ranking. Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in Financial Times Global MBA Ranking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals. It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the Professional Ranking World Universities, and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK\\'s major companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10. Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.\\r\\n\\r\\n Student life \\r\\n\\r\\n Traditions \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright|An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\\r\\n\\r\\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum. This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.See, for instance,  In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Trashing\\' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford\\'s Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBalls are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually black tie. Punting is a common summer leisure activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the All Souls Mallard song.\\r\\n\\r\\n Clubs and societies \\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\\r\\nthumb|Oxford Union\\'s debating chamber\\r\\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as Octopush and quidditch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent Cherwell and OUSU\\'s The Oxford Student. Other publications include the Isis magazine, the satirical Oxymoron, the graduate Oxonian Review, the Oxford Political Review, and the online only newspaper The Oxford Blue. The student radio station is Oxide Radio. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the Scientific Society. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries, and cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invitation-only societies such as the Bullingdon Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time. The Oxford Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004, and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe and overseas.\\r\\n\\r\\n Student union and common rooms \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU, exists to represent students in the university\\'s decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford\\'s more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College\\'s entire student population is represented by a combined Students\\' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.\\r\\n\\r\\n Notable alumni \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise.

Its history began with Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria, who developed his vision for a cultural area that included the Royal Albert Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum and several royal colleges. In 1907, Imperial College London was established by royal charter, unifying the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City and Guilds of London Institute. In 1988, the Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by merging with St Mary\\'s Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial College London focuses on science, engineering, business, and medicine. The main campus is in South Kensington, where most teaching and research takes place. A second campus in White City provides a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship. Facilities also include teaching hospitals throughout London that form an academic health science centre. The college was previously a member of the University of London and became an independent university in 2007. Imperial has a highly international community, with 59% of students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nthumb|upright|Prince Albert was the main patron of the early Royal Colleges and the development of an area of culture in South Kensington\\r\\n\\r\\n 19th century \\r\\nThe earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament.  This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the Royal School of Mines. The medical school has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being Charing Cross Hospital Medical School which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at Westminster Hospital in 1834, and St Mary\\'s Hospital in 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1851, the Great Exhibition was organised as an exhibition of culture and industry by Henry Cole and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria.  An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in South Kensington. Within the next six years the Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry, and in 1881 the opening of the Royal School of Mines and Natural History Museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|Imperial Institute, now the site of Queen\\'s Lawn\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1881, the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of Thomas Huxley, taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines. The school was renamed the Royal College of Science by royal consent in 1890. The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute was opened as a technical education school on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales in 1884, with courses beginning in 1885.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Royal College of Science\\r\\n\\r\\n20th century\\r\\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Great Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as – if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – its Central Technical College.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 July 1907, Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London. The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910. The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute, the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by King Edward VII in July 1909.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs students at Imperial had to study separately for London degrees, in January 1919, students and alumni voted for a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London. In response, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a BSc.\\r\\nthumb|left|Royal School of Mines\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1945, George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. \"Commemoration Day\", named after this visit, is held every October as the university\\'s main graduation ceremony. The college also acquired a biology field station at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire in 1947\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Second World War, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science – this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 and Barlow Committee in 1946 called for a \"British MIT\"-equivalent, backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including Lord Cherwell, Sir Lawrence Bragg and Sir Edward Appleton. The University Grants Committee strongly opposed however, and so a compromise was reached in 1953, where Imperial would remain within the university, but double in size over the next ten years. The expansion led to a number of new buildings being erected. These included the Hill building in 1957 and the Physics building in 1960, and the completion of the East Quadrangle, built in four stages between 1959 and 1965. The building work also meant the demolition of the City and Guilds College building in 1962–63, and the Imperial Institute\\'s building by 1967. Opposition from the Royal Fine Arts Commission and others meant that Queen\\'s Tower was retained, with work carried out between 1966 and 1968 to make it free standing. New laboratories for biochemistry, established with the support of a £350,000 grant from the Wolfson Foundation, were opened by the Queen in 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary\\'s Hospital Medical School under the Imperial College Act 1988. Amendments to the royal charter changed the formal name of the institution to The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine and made St Mary\\'s a constituent college. This was followed by mergers with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997, with the Imperial College Act 1997 formally establishing the Imperial College School of Medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n 21st century \\r\\nIn 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. In 2004, the Imperial College Business School and a new main college entrance on Exhibition Road were opened. The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London. Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2011, Imperial and King\\'s College London joined the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation as partners with a commitment of £40 million each to the project. The centre was later renamed the Francis Crick Institute and opened on 9 November 2016. It is the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe. The college began moving into the new White City campus in 2016, with the launching of the Innovation Hub. This was followed by the opening of the Molecular Sciences Research Hub for the Department of Chemistry, officially opened by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nCampuses\\r\\nthumb|Imperial College Business School and College Main Entrance|222x222px\\r\\n\\r\\n South Kensington \\r\\nThe South Kensington campus is the college\\'s main campus, where most teaching and research takes place.

The student body is 39% female and 61% male. 36.5% of Imperial\\'s undergraduates are privately educated, the fourth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibraries\\r\\nThe college\\'s main library is located next to Queen\\'s Lawn and contains the main corpus of the college\\'s collection. It previously also housed the Science Museum\\'s library until 2014. The Fleming library is located at St Mary\\'s in Paddington, originally the library of St Mary\\'s Hospital Medical School, with other hospital campuses also having college libraries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicine\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Imperial Faculty of Medicine was formed through mergers between Imperial and the St Mary\\'s, Charing Cross and Westminster, and Royal Postgraduate medical schools and has six teaching hospitals. It accepts more than 300 undergraduate medical students per year and has around 321 taught and 700 research full-time equivalent postgraduate students.\\r\\nthumb|Imperial College London Diabetes Centre, Abu Dhabi\\r\\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte\\'s and Chelsea Hospital) and St Mary\\'s NHS Trust (St. Mary\\'s Hospital and Western Eye Hospital) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine. It is an academic health science centre and manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital, Queen Charlotte\\'s and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, St Mary\\'s Hospital, and Western Eye Hospital. The Trust is currently one of the largest in the UK and in 2012/13 had a turnover of £971.3 million, employed approximately 9,770 people and treated almost 1.2 million patients.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther (non-academic health science centres) hospitals affiliated with Imperial College include Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital, West Middlesex University Hospital, Hillingdon Hospital, Mount Vernon Hospital, Harefield Hospital, Ealing Hospital, Central Middlesex Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital, St Mark\\'s Hospital, St Charles\\' Hospital and St Peter\\'s Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\n Controversies \\r\\n Accusations of bullying \\r\\nIn 2003, it was reported that one third of female academics \"believe that discrimination or bullying by managers has held back their careers\". Imperial has since won the Athena SWAN Award, which recognises employment practices that are supportive of the careers of women in science, technology, engineering and maths.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, concerns were raised about the methods that were being used to fire people in the Faculty of Medicine. In 2014, Stefan Grimm, of the Department of Medicine, was found dead after being threatened with dismissal for failure to raise enough grant money. His last email before his death accused his employers of bullying by demanding that he should get grants worth at least £200,000 per year. The college announced an internal inquiry into Stefan Grimm\\'s death, and found that the performance metrics for his position were unreasonable, with new metrics for performance being needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of bullying within the staff at Imperial resurfaced in November 2020 when Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds North West asked the Secretary of State for Education in a written question on 24 November what steps the Office for Students had taken in response to a report by Jane McNeill QC dated 25 August which found that bullying had taken place at Imperial under the President (Alice Gast) and the Chief Financial Officer. Michelle Donelan, the Conservative MP for Chippenham, responded for the Department for Education that \"The Office for Students (OfS) is considering the information it has received in relation to this matter, in line with their normal processes. As is standard practice, the OfS cannot comment on individual cases\". The college was accused of a cover-up by the Universities and Colleges Union in December 2020 when it refused to publish McNeill\\'s report, even in redacted form. The Chair of Council said that the report was kept confidential to preserve the anonymity of people who gave evidence, that its recommendations had been accepted by the senior leadership team, and that these recommendations were being implemented in full. A disciplinary panel decided that Gast\\'s dismissal as president was not warranted and spokesperson for the college said that she had \"offered wholehearted apologies to those affected\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 February 2021, it was announced that the OfS would formally investigate allegations of bullying.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent life\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent body\\r\\nFor the  academic year, Imperial had a total full-time student body of , consisting of  undergraduate students and  postgraduates. 50.7% of the student body is from outside of the UK. 32% of all full-time students came from outside the European Union in 2013–14, and around 13% of the International students had Chinese nationality in 2007–08.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial\\'s male to female ratio for undergraduate students is uneven at approximately 64:36 overall and 5:1 or higher in some engineering courses. However, medicine has an approximate 1:1 ratio with biology degrees tending to be higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial College Union\\r\\nImperial College Union is the students\\' union and is run by five full-time sabbatical officers elected from the student body for a tenure of one year, and a number of permanent members of staff. It is split into constituent unions aligned with the faculties of the college, carrying on the association with the original constituent colleges of Imperial, the Royal College of Science Union, City and Guilds College Union, Royal School of Mines Students\\' Union and Imperial College School of Medicine Students\\' Union.  The Union is given a large subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining over 300 clubs, projects and societies. Examples of notable student groups and projects are Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America. The Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union operates on two sites, with most events at the Union Building on Beit Quad at South Kensington, with mostly medical school events at the Reynold\\'s bar, Charing Cross.\\r\\n\\r\\n Facilities \\r\\nalt=|thumb|Ethos Gym\\r\\nSports facilities at Imperial\\'s London campuses include four gyms, including the main Ethos gym at the South Kensington Campus, two swimming pools and two sports halls. Imperial has additional sports facilities at the Heston and Harlington sports grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the South Kensington campus, there are a total of six music practice rooms which consist of upright pianos for usage by people of any grade, and grand pianos which are exclusively for people who have achieved Grade 8 or above.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two student bars on the South Kensington campus, one at the Imperial College Union and one at Eastside.\\r\\nThere are a number of pubs and bars on campus and also surrounding the campus, which become a popular social activity for Imperial\\'s students. The Pewter tankard collection at Imperial College Union is the largest in Europe, with the majority of clubs and societies having tankards associated with their clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The weekly college farmer\\'s market\\r\\n\\r\\n Student media \\r\\nImperial College Radio\\r\\nImperial College Radio (ICRadio) was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student halls of residence from a studio under Southside, actually commencing broadcasts in late 1976. It now broadcasts from the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial College TV\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial College TV (ICTV) is Imperial College Union\\'s TV station, founded in 1969 and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block. The department had bought an early AMPEX Type A 1-inch videotape recorder and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972. Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block.\\r\\n\\r\\nFelix Newspaper\\r\\n\\r\\nFelix is weekly student newspaper, first released on 9 December 1949. In addition to news, Felix also carries comic strips, features, opinions, puzzles and reviews, plus reports of trips and Imperial College sporting events.thumb|Racing Green Endurance is a student-led project to demonstrate the potential of zero-emission cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent societies\\r\\nImperial College Boat Club\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Imperial College Boat Club is the rowing club of Imperial and was founded on 12 December 1919. The college\\'s boat house is located in Putney on the Thames, and was recently refurbished, reopening in 2014. The club has a number of notable accolades, such as three alumni of the college in the gold medal-winning GB 8+ at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.\\r\\n\\r\\nSports\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial College has over 60 sports clubs, of which many participate in the British Universities and Colleges Sport Association leagues such as American Football, Rugby, Badminton, Lacrosse, Football, Ice Hockey, and many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nExploration Club\\r\\nthumb|Beit Hallthumb|220px|Prince\\'s Gardens in the snow, surrounded by college halls of residenceImperial\\'s Exploration Board was established in 1957 to assist students with a desire for exploration. Trips have included Afghanistan, Alaska, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Fiji, the Himalayas, Iran, Morocco, Norway, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine, and the Yukon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDramatic Society\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Imperial College Dramatic Society (DramSoc) is one of two major theatrical arts societies, with the other being the Musical Theatre Society, and it was founded in 1912. The society puts on three major plays each year, in addition to several smaller fringe productions. It is additionally one of the London-based dramatic societies to participate in the London Student Drama Festival, and regularly attends the Edinburgh Fringe. DramSoc is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of the Union\\'s theatrical space, the Union Concert Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Techtonics\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Techtonics are an all-male a cappella group from Imperial College London, and are a part of the Imperial College A Cappella Society. The group was formed in 2008, and has since risen to prominence in the world a cappella scene. The group is best known for winning the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent housing\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial College owns and manages twenty-three halls of residence in Inner London, Acton, and Ascot. Over three thousand rooms are available, guaranteeing first year undergraduates a place in College residences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having en suite facilities. Bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. All rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network. Most of them are considered among the newest student halls at London universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates, as they are granted a room once they have selected Imperial as their firm offer with UCAS. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a \"hall senior\", and places are available for a small number of returning students in the Evelyn Garden halls. Some students also live in International Students House, London.\\r\\n\\r\\n Notable alumni, faculty and staff \\r\\n\\r\\nNobel laureates: (medicine) Sir Alexander Fleming, Sir Ernst Boris Chain, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, Sir Andrew Fielding Huxley, Rodney Robert Porter, (physics) Abdus Salam, Sir George Paget Thomson, Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett, Dennis Gabor, Peter Higgs, (chemistry) Sir Norman Haworth, Sir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood, Sir Derek Barton, Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson, Sir George Porter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFields medalists: Klaus Friedrich Roth, Sir Simon Donaldson, Martin Hairer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcademic affiliations include: Sir Tom Kibble, co-discoverer of Higgs Boson;‘KIBBLE, Sir Thomas (Walter Bannerman)’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2016; online edn, Nov 2016 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Tejinder Virdee, experimental particle physicist;  Narinder Singh Kapany, inventor of fibre optics; Sir John Pendry, theoretical solid state physicist; Sir Christopher Kelk Ingold, physical organic chemistry pioneer;‘INGOLD, Sir Christopher (Keik)’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir William Henry Perkin, discoverer of the first synthetic organic chemical dye mauveine;‘PERKIN, Sir William Henry’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2015; online edn, Feb 2015 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Edward Frankland, originator of the theory of chemical valency;‘FRANKLAND, Sir Edward’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir William Crookes, discoverer of thallium;‘CROOKES, Prof. Sir William’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Alan Fersht, chemist; David Phillips, chemist; Harold Hopkins, contributed to the theory and design of optical instruments;‘HOPKINS, Prof. Harold Horace’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Alfred North Whitehead, mathematician and philosopher;‘WHITEHEAD, Alfred North’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017 Sir Steven Cowley, physicist and president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford; and Sir John Ambrose Fleming, inventor of the vacuum tube.‘FLEMING, Sir (John) Ambrose’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 2 April 2017\\r\\nIn biology and medicine; Thomas Huxley, advocate of the theory of evolution; Azeem Majeed.

In international rankings, it consistently places as one of the best universities worldwide, typically securing a position as one of Europe\\'s top five universities besides the University of Oxford, University College London, Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike its sister institution, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), ETH Zurich is part of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain, a consortium of government universities and research institutes under the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research. As a public institution, it grants admission to every Swiss resident who has matriculated. , ETH Zurich enrolled 24,500 students from over 120 countries, of which 4,460 were pursuing doctoral degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents, faculty, and researchers affiliated with ETH Zurich include 22 Nobel laureates, two Fields Medalists, three Pritzker Prize winners, and one Turing Award recipient, including Albert Einstein and John von Neumann. It is a founding member of the IDEA League and the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), and a member of the CESAER network.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nETH Zurich was founded on 7 February 1854 by the Swiss Confederation and began giving its first lectures on 16 October 1855 as a polytechnic institute (eidgenössische polytechnische Schule) at various sites throughout the city of Zürich. It was initially composed of six faculties: architecture, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, forestry, and an integrated department for the fields of mathematics, natural sciences, literature, and social and political sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is locally still known as Polytechnikum, or simply as Poly, derived from the original name eidgenössische polytechnische Schule, which translates to \"federal polytechnic school\".\\r\\n\\r\\nETH Zurich is a federal institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the University of Zurich is a cantonal institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a \"federal university\", while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had. In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zurich.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of Jérôme Franel, the course program of ETH Zurich was restructured to that of a real university and ETH Zurich was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909 the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule. In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes form the \"ETH Domain\" with the aim of collaborating on scientific projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmission and education\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Swiss students, ETH Zurich is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. Like every public university in Switzerland, ETH Zurich is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the Matura. Applicants from foreign countries are required to take either the reduced entrance exam or the comprehensive entrance exam although some applicants from several European countries are exempt from this rule. An applicant can be admitted to ETH Zurich even without any verifiable educational records by passing the comprehensive entrance exam.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Examinations are often held during examination sessions which are immediately before the beginning of the next semester (only a few select courses offer an exam immediately after the semester ends). After the first year of study, bachelor students must pass a block examination of all courses taken in the first year, called the Basisprüfung (basis examination). The pass rate of basis examination is low. If the weighted average score is not sufficient, a student is required to retake the entire Basisprüfung which usually means having to re-sit the whole first year. The structure of examinations in higher academic years is similar to the Basisprüfung, but with a higher success rate. The regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the Bachelor of Science degree and three or four further semesters for the Master of Science degree. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at masters level, admission becomes very selective, although undergraduate qualifiers at ETH and EPFL are guaranteed admission (known as consecutive masters).\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation at ETH Zurich generally focuses more on theoretical aspects than application and most degree programs contain a high amount of mathematical training. The main language of instruction in undergraduate (Bachelor) studies is German and for admission a proof of sufficient knowledge of the German language is required for Bachelor students. Most Master\\'s programs and doctoral studies are in English.\\r\\n\\r\\nRankings\\r\\n\\r\\nETH Zurich is ranked among the top universities in the world. Typically, popular rankings place the institution as the best university in continental Europe and ETH Zurich is consistently ranked among the top 1–5 universities in Europe, and among the top 3–10 best universities of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, ETH Zurich has achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of chemistry, mathematics and physics. There are 32 Nobel laureates who are associated with ETH Zurich, the most recent of whom is Richard F. Heck, awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2010. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus.\\r\\n\\r\\n Overall rankings \\r\\nIn the QS World University Rankings 2021, ETH Zurich again ranked 6th in the world, having first achieved this position in 2019, thereby overtaking the University of Cambridge and becoming the second-best European university after the University of Oxford.

ETH Zurich had a total budget of CHF 1,897 billion in the year 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nCampus\\r\\n\\r\\nETH Zurich has two campuses. The main building was constructed 1858–1864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but nowadays it is located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, ETH Zurich spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. As a result, the Zentrum campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout Zürich and firmly integrates the ETH Zurich in the city. The main building stands directly across the street from the University Hospital of Zurich and the University of Zurich.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH Zurich, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the Hönggerberg on a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003; since then, the Hönggerberg location houses the departments of architecture, civil engineering, biology, chemistry, materials science and physics.alt=Main building and surrounding campus.|thumb|Main building and surrounding campus.\\r\\nthumb|The Hauptgebäude, constructed in 1864, is the Polytechnikum\\'s original and main building\\r\\n\\r\\nMain building\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main building of ETH Zurich was built from 1858 to 1864 under Gustav Zeuner; the architect, however, was Gottfried Semper, who was a professor of architecture at ETH Zurich at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a neoclassical style that was unique to him; and the namesake and architect of the Semperoper in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of Andrea Palladio and Donato Bramante. During the construction of the University of Zurich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912–1914). At about the same time, Semper\\'s ETH Zurich building was enlarged and received its cupola. The university\\'s engineering and computer science departments are located around here.alt=Aerial picture of the Hönggerberg campus.

During the school week, the bus runs 3 times an hour, and takes around 15 minutes. In 2020 a new, fully electric, ETH eLink was introduced.\\r\\n\\r\\n Bike share \\r\\nSince 2018, an electric bike sharing system between the two campuses is also available, with yearly subscriptions subsidised by the university. There are rental stations on both campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics\\r\\nThe ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (LIB) is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and the use of ion beam based techniques with applications in archeology, earth sciences, life sciences, material sciences and fundamental physics. An example of such application is the tracing of isotopes and the detection of rare radionuclides with radiocarbon dating and the use of techniques such as Rutherford backscattering spectrometry or elastic recoil detection. The LIB is developing the next generation of AMS machines. It is also a laboratory available for users interested in applying the techniques of ion beam analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent life\\r\\nthumb|Students and locals in ETH Zurich\\'s front courtyard\\r\\n\\r\\n Tuition and financial assistance \\r\\nBeing a public university, the heavily subsidized (by Swiss federal tax) tuition fees are CHF 730 per semester, regardless of the student\\'s nationality.\\r\\nBoth merit and need based scholarships are also available. \\r\\nThe Excellence Scholarship & Opportunity Programme (ESOP) is a merit scholarship program for master students with excellent grades in their undergraduate program.\\r\\n\\r\\n Student associations \\r\\nETH Zurich has well over 100 student associations.List of all Study Associations, Committees, Associated and Recognized Associations of VSETH.

The Latin stress on the long vowel of the Gaulish name, , was lost in German  but is preserved in Italian  and in Romansh . The first development towards its later Germanic form is attested as early as the 6th century with the form Ziurichi. From the 9th century onward, the name is established in an Old High German form  (857 in villa Zurih, 924 in Zurich curtem, 1416 Zürich Stadt).Zürcher Ortsnamen – Entstehung und Bedeutung, H.

Traces of pre-Roman Celtic, La Tène settlements were discovered near the Lindenhof, a morainic hill dominating the SE - NW waterway constituted by Lake Zurich and the river Limmat. In Roman times, during the conquest of the alpine region in 15 BC, the Romans built a castellum on the Lindenhof. Later here was erected Turicum (a toponym of clear Celtic origin), a tax-collecting point for goods trafficked on the Limmat, which constituted part of the border between Gallia Belgica (from AD 90 Germania Superior) and Raetia: this customs point developed later into a vicus. After Emperor Constantine\\'s reforms in AD 318, the border between Gaul and Italy (two of the four praetorian prefectures of the Roman Empire) was located east of Turicum, crossing the river Linth between Lake Walen and Lake Zürich, where a castle and garrison looked over Turicum\\'s safety. The earliest written record of the town dates from the 2nd century, with a tombstone referring to it as to the  (\"Zürich post for collecting the 2.5% value tax of the Galliae\"), discovered at the Lindenhof.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 5th century, the Germanic Alemanni tribe settled in the Swiss Plateau. The Roman castle remained standing until the 7th century. A Carolingian castle, built on the site of the Roman castle by the grandson of Charlemagne, Louis the German, is mentioned in 835 (in castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci). Louis also founded the Fraumünster abbey in 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Zürich, Uri, and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nZürich gained Imperial immediacy (, becoming an Imperial free city) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the Zähringer family and attained a status comparable to statehood. During the 1230s, a city wall was built, enclosing 38 hectares, when the earliest stone houses on the Rennweg were built as well. The Carolingian castle was used as a quarry, as it had started to fall into ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor Frederick II promoted the abbess of the  to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess nominated the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. The political power of the convent slowly waned in the 14th century, beginning with the establishment of the  (guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun, who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not nominated by the abbess.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important event in the early 14th century was the completion of the Manesse Codex, a key source of medieval German poetry. The famous illuminated manuscript – described as \"the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries;\"Ingeborg Glier, reviewing Koschorreck and Werner 1981 in Speculum 59.1 (January 1984), p 169. – was commissioned by the Manesse family of Zürich, copied and illustrated in the city at some time between 1304 and 1340. Producing such a work was a highly expensive prestige project, requiring several years work by highly skilled scribesKoschorreck and Werner 1981 discern no fewer than eleven scribes, some working simultaneously, in the production. and miniature painters, and it clearly testifies to the increasing wealth and pride of Zürich citizens in this period. The work contains 6 songs by Süsskind von Trimberg, who may have been a Jew, since the work itself contains reflections on medieval Jewish life, though little is known about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mention of Jews in Zürich was in 1273. Sources show that there was a synagogue in Zürich in the 13th century, implying the existence of a Jewish community. With the rise of the Black Death in 1349, Zürich, like most other Swiss cities, responded by persecuting and burning the local Jews, marking the end of the first Jewish community there. The second Jewish community of Zürich, formed towards the end of the 14th century, was short-lived, and Jews were expulsed and banned from the city from 1423 until the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n Archaeological findings \\r\\nA woman who died in about 200 BC was found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy wool dress, a scarf and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Swiss Confederacy\\r\\nthumb|A scene depicting the Old Zürich War in 1443 (1514, illustration in Federal Chronicle by Werner Schodoler)\\r\\nOn 1 May 1351, the citizens of Zürich had to swear allegiance before representatives of the cantons of Lucerne, Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden, the other members of the Swiss Confederacy. Thus, Zürich became the fifth member of the Confederacy, which was at that time a loose confederation of de facto independent states. Zürich was the presiding canton of the Diet from 1468 to 1519. This authority was the executive council and lawmaking body of the confederacy, from the Middle Ages until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848. Zürich was temporarily expelled from the confederacy in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of Toggenburg (the Old Zürich War). Neither side had attained significant victory when peace was agreed upon in 1446, and Zürich was readmitted to the confederation in 1450.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|The  of 1576\\r\\nZwingli started the Swiss Reformation at the time when he was the main preacher in the 1520s, at the . He lived there from 1484 until his death in 1531. The Zürich Bible, based on that of Zwingli, was issued in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Zürich, spreading also to a number of other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the Wars of Kappel.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Zürich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The Thirty Years\\' War which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Zürich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city. In this time the political system of Zürich was an oligarchy (): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, Bürkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, Mülner, von Orelli.\\r\\nthumb|Fighting on the  during the \\r\\nThe Helvetic Revolution of 1798 saw the fall of the . Zürich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803 and 1805. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the  of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city\\'s hegemony. The Treaty of Zürich between Austria, France, and Sardinia was signed in 1859.New International Encyclopedia.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern history\\r\\nthumb|left| in 1900\\r\\nZürich was the Federal capital for 1839–40, and consequently, the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Zürich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845–46, Zürich took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. Following the Sonderbund war and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Zürich voted in favour of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years\\' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jews also began to settle in Zürich following their equality in 1862, the Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich was founded.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Aerial view (1961)\\r\\nExtensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the , the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Zürich with Baden, putting the  at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the  (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Zürich\\'s  (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the Zürich Stock Exchange was founded in 1877. Industrialisation led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Zürich.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe  are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Zürich, as the construction of the new lake front transformed Zürich from a small medieval town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to an attractive modern city on the  shore, under the guidance of the city engineer Arnold Bürkli.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Zürich, including Aussersihl, the workman\\'s quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Zürich.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Zürich were incorporated.\\r\\n\\r\\nZürich was accidentally bombed during World War II. As persecuted Jews sought refuge in Switzerland, the SIG (Israelite Community of Switzerland) raised financial resources. The central committee for refugee aid, created in 1933, was located in Zürich.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe canton of Zürich did not recognise the Jewish religious communities as legal entities (and therefore as equal to national churches) until 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoat of arms\\r\\nthumb|upright|The coat of arms on the Town Hall\\r\\nleft|thumb|Greater coat of arms\\r\\nThe blue and white coat of arms of Zürich is attested from 1389 and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315. The first certain testimony of banners with the same design is from 1434. The coat of arms is flanked by two lions. The red  on top of the banner had varying interpretations: For the people of Zürich, it was a mark of honour, granted by Rudolph I. Zürich\\'s neighbours mocked it as a sign of shame, commemorating the loss of the banner at Winterthur in 1292. Today, the Canton of Zürich uses the same coat of arms as the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitics\\r\\n\\r\\nCity districts\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Zürich\\'s twelve municipal districts\\r\\nThe previous boundaries of the city of Zürich (before 1893) were more or less synonymous with the location of the old town. Two large expansions of the city limits occurred in 1893 and in 1934 when the city of Zürich merged with many surrounding municipalities, that had been growing increasingly together since the 19th century. Today, the city is divided into twelve districts (known as  in German), numbered 1 to 12, each one of which contains between one and four neighborhoods:\\r\\n , known as , contains the old town, both to the east and west of the start of the Limmat.

It is composed of nine councilors, each presiding over a department. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. The mayor () is elected as such by a public election by a system of Majorz while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. Any resident of Zurich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. In the mandate period 2022–2026 (Legislatur) the City Council is presided by mayor Corine Mauch. The executive body holds its meetings in the City Hall (), on the left bank of the Limmat. The building was built in 1883 in Renaissance style.\\r\\n\\r\\n, the Zürich City Council is made up of four representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party, one of whom is the mayor), two members each of the Green Party and the FDP (Free Democratic Party), and one member of GLP (Green Liberal Party), giving the left parties a combined six out of nine seats.

The sessions of the Municipal Council are held in public. Unlike those of the City Council, the members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession but are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Zürich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The legislative body holds its meetings in the town hall (), on the right bank of the Limmat opposite to the City Hall ().\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last election of the Municipal Council was held on 4 March 2018 for the mandate period of 2022–2026. , the Municipal Council consist of 37 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP), 23 The Liberals (FDP), 18 Green Party (GPS), 16 Green Liberal Party (GLP), 14 members of the Swiss People\\'s Party (SVP), 8 Alternative List (AL), and three members of the Evangelical People\\'s Party (EVP), giving the left parties an  absolute majority of total 63 seats with only one seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nElections\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Council\\r\\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the SPS which received 25.6% (-6) of the vote.

The Alps can be seen from the city center, background to the lake.\\r\\nZürich is situated at  above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake Zürich () about  north of the Alps, nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat, which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about  north of where the river issues from Lake Zürich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley () and to the north in the Limmat Valley (). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nTopography\\r\\nThe municipality of Zürich has an area of , of which  is made up of Lake Zürich. The area includes a section of the northern Swiss Plateau. The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast–northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of . The partially channeled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in Oberengstringen at  above sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|Topographic map of Zürich and surroundings\\r\\nthumb|Felsenegg from Lake Zürich\\r\\nthumb|Zürich from Waidberg\\r\\nOn its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the Albis chain, which runs along the western border. The Uetliberg is, with  above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the Uetlibergbahn. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist (), the Hönggerberg (), the Käferberg (), the Zürichberg (), the Adlisberg () and the Öschbrig (). Between the Käferberg and the Zürichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about ), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the Katzensee (nature reserve) and the Büsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate\\r\\nZürich has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with warm summers and four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Zürich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The Foehn wind, which plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys, also has some impact on Zürich.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual mean temperature at the measuring station of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Zürich-Fluntern ( above sea level on the slope of the Zürichberg,  above the level of the city centre) is . The lowest monthly mean of daily minimum temperature are measured in January with  and the highest monthly mean of daily maximum temperature are measured in July with . On average there are 74.9 days in which the minimum temperature is below  (so-called frost days), and 23.7 days in which the maximum temperature is below  (so-called ice days). There are on average 30 so-called summer days (maximum temperature equal to or above ) throughout the year, while so-called heat days (with maximum temperature equal to or above ) are 5.8 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average high temperature in July is  and average low temperature is . The highest recorded temperature in Zürich was , recorded in July 1947, and typically the warmest day reaches an average of .\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring and autumn are generally cool to mild, but sometimes with large differences between warm and cold days even during the same year. The highest temperature of the month March in 2014 was on the 20th at  during a sunny afternoon and the lowest temperature was on the 25th at  during the night/early morning. Record low of average daily temperatures in March since 1864 is  and record high of average daily temperatures in March is . Record low of average daily temperatures in October is  and record high of average daily temperatures in October is .\\r\\n\\r\\nZürich has an average of 1,544 hours of sunshine per year and shines on 38% of its potential time throughout the year. During the months April until September the sun shines between 150 and 215 hours per month. The  rainfall spread on 133.9 days with precipitation throughout the year. Roughly about every third day you will encounter at least some precipitation, which is very much a Swiss average. During the warmer half of the year and especially during the three summer months, the strength of rainfall is higher than those measured in winter, but the days with precipitation stays about the same throughout the year (in average 9.9–12.7 days per month). October has the lowest number (9.9) of days with some precipitation. There is an average of 59.5 so-called bright days (number of days with sunshine duration greater than 80%) through the year, the most in July and August (7.4, 7.7 days), and the least in January and December (2.7, 1.8 days). The average number of days with sunshine duration less than 20%, so-called cloudy days, is 158.4 days, while the most cloudy days are in November (17.8 days), December (21.7 days), and January with 19 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate protection\\r\\nIn November 2008 the people of Zürich voted in a public referendum to write into law the quantifiable and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO2 per person per annum by 2050. This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if the costs are higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli (Minergie-P quality – passive house), the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban area\\r\\nThe areas surrounding the Limmat are almost completely developed with residential, industrial, and commercial zones. The sunny and desirable residential areas in the hills overlooking Zürich, Waidberg and Zürichberg, and the bottom part of the slope on the western side of the valley on the Uetliberg, are also densely built.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"green lungs\" of the city include the vast forest areas of Adlisberg, Zürichberg, Käferberg, Hönggerberg and Uetliberg. Major parks are also located along the lakeshore (Zürichhorn and Enge), while smaller parks dot the city. Larger contiguous agricultural lands are located near Affoltern and Seebach. Of the total area of the municipality of Zürich (in 1996, without the lake), 45.4% is residential, industrial and commercial, 15.5% is transportation infrastructure, 26.5% is forest, 11%: is agriculture and 1.2% is water.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransport\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic transport\\r\\nthumb|A paddle steamer on Lake Zürich\\r\\nPublic transport is extremely popular in Zürich, and its inhabitants use public transport in large numbers.

In addition, the public transport network includes funicular railways and even the Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg (LAF), a cable car between Adliswil and Felsenegg. Tickets purchased for a trip are valid on all means of public transportation (train, tram, bus, boat).

The so-called \"Masterplan Velo\"Masterplan Velo  Stadt Zürich. Retrieved 29 November 2016 is part of the superordinate framework Stadtverkehr 2025 which shapes the future of the different means of transport. Research revealed that infrastructure and the social environment are essential factors in improving a city\\'s appeal to bicycle traffic. Three main goals are specified: First, the modal share of bicycle traffic should be enhanced to twice the value of 2011 by 2015. Second, cyclists\\' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes () for everyday use and comfort routes (), with the latter focusing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special  providing bike-related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day.Mit dem Velo in den Autobahntunnel Neue Zürcher Zeitung.

The institution of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, was delayed to at least 2019. Pro Velo, a nationwide interest group, has publicly questioned whether the masterplan already failed. The critique aims at badly governed traffic management at construction sites, missing possibilities to park bikes in the city as well as rather diffident ambitions.

However, because of Zürich\\'s national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, its inhabitants and commuters speak all kinds of Swiss German dialects. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks diglossic Swiss German/Swiss Standard German as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak Standard German in their family environment (\"at home\"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population, then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include: Bosnian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%), and Albanian (2.3%).

Another Swiss city with a comparable status was Geneva, the so-called Protestant Rome, where John Calvin and his Protestant Reformers operated, as well as Basel. Zürich attracted other influential Protestant Reformers like Heinrich Bullinger. Zwingli translated the Bible (Zürich Bible) into the local variety of German, and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess Katharina von Zimmern, and the largely peasant population of the Canton of Zürich. The canton unanimously adopted the Reformed tradition, as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the Swiss Confederacy.

Founded by the town council under the authority of a royal charter of King James VI in 1582 and officially opened in 1583, it is one of Scotland\\'s four ancient universities and the sixth-oldest university in continuous operation in the English-speaking world. The university played an important role in Edinburgh becoming a chief intellectual centre during the Scottish Enlightenment and contributed to the city being nicknamed the \"Athens of the North.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nIn academic rankings, Edinburgh is positioned among the top universities in the United Kingdom and the world. It is a member of several associations of research-intensive universities, including the Coimbra Group, League of European Research Universities, Russell Group, Una Europa, and Universitas 21. In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, it had a total income of £1.262\\xa0billion, of which £331.6\\xa0million was from research grants and contracts. It has the third-largest endowment in the UK, behind only Cambridge and Oxford. The university occupies five main campuses in the city of Edinburgh, which include many buildings of historical and architectural significance such as those in the Old Town.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh is the seventh-largest university in the UK by enrolment and receives over 75,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the second-most popular university in the UK by volume of applications. Edinburgh had the eighth-highest average UCAS points amongst British universities for new entrants in 2020. The university continues to have links to the royal family, having had Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as its chancellor from 1953 to 2010 and Anne, Princess Royal since March 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlumni of the university include inventor Alexander Graham Bell, naturalist Charles Darwin, philosopher David Hume, physicist James Clerk Maxwell, and writers such as Sir J. M. Barrie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, J. K. Rowling, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The university counts several heads of state and government amongst its graduates, including three British Prime Ministers. Three Supreme Court Justices of the UK were educated at Edinburgh. , 19 Nobel Prize laureates, four Pulitzer Prize winners, three Turing Award winners, and an Abel Prize laureate and Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Edinburgh as alumni or academic staff. Edinburgh alumni have won a total of ten Olympic gold medals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nEarly history\\r\\nleft|thumb|Robert Rollock, Regent (1583–1586) and first principal (1586–1599) of the University of Edinburgh\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1557, Bishop Robert Reid of St Magnus Cathedral on Orkney made a will containing an endowment of 8,000\\xa0merks to build a college in Edinburgh.  Unusually for his time, Reid\\'s vision included the teaching of rhetoric and poetry, alongside more traditional subjects such as philosophy. However, the bequest was delayed by more than 25 years due to the religious revolution that led to the Reformation Parliament of 1560. The plans were revived in the late 1570s through efforts by the Edinburgh Town Council, first minister of Edinburgh James Lawson, and Lord Provost William Little. When Reid\\'s descendants were unwilling to pay out the sum, the town council petitioned King James VI and his Privy Council. The King brokered a monetary compromise and granted a royal charter on 14 April 1582, empowering the town council to create a college of higher education. A college established by secular authorities was unprecedented in newly Presbyterian Scotland, as all previous Scottish universities had been founded through papal bulls. Notably, Edinburgh was the fourth Scottish university in a period when the richer and more populous England had only two.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Main buildings of King James\\' College in 1647, lying in a double courtyard on the lower left\\r\\nleft|thumb|Frontispiece to earliest laureation (graduation) register (1587)\\r\\nNamed Tounis College (Town\\'s College), the university opened its doors to students on 14 October 1583, with an attendance of 80–90. At the time, the college mainly covered liberal arts and divinity. Instruction began under the charge of a graduate from the University of St Andrews, theologian Robert Rollock, who first served as Regent, and from 1586 as principal of the college. Initially Rollock was the sole instructor for first-year students, and he was expected to tutor the 1583 intake for all four years of their degree in every subject. The first cohort finished their studies in 1587, and 47 students graduated (or \\'laureated\\') with an M.A. degree. When King James VI visited Scotland in 1617, he held a disputation with the college\\'s professors, after which he decreed that it should henceforth be called the \"Colledge [sic] of King James\". The university was known as both Tounis College and King James\\' College until it gradually assumed the name of the University of Edinburgh during the 17th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the deposition of King James II and VII during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Parliament of Scotland passed legislation designed to root out Jacobite sympathisers amongst university staff. In Edinburgh, this led to the dismissal of Principal Alexander Monro and several professors and regents after a government visitation in 1690. The university was subsequently led by Principal Gilbert Rule, one of the inquisitors on the visitation committee.\\r\\n\\r\\n18th and 19th century\\r\\n\\r\\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries were marked by a power struggle between the university and town council, which had ultimate authority over staff appointments, curricula, and examinations. After a series of challenges by the university, the conflict culminated in the council seizing the college records in 1704. Relations were only gradually repaired over the next 150 years and suffered repeated setbacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university expanded by founding a Faculty of Law in 1707, a Faculty of Arts in 1708, and a Faculty of Medicine in 1726. In 1762, Reverend Hugh Blair was appointed by King George III as the first Regius Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres. This formalised literature as a subject and marks the foundation of the English Literature department, making Edinburgh the oldest centre of literary education in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 18th century, the university was at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment. The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment fell on especially fertile ground in Edinburgh because of the university\\'s democratic and secular origin; its organization as a single entity instead of loosely connected colleges, which encouraged academic exchange; its adoption of the more flexible Dutch model of professorship, rather than having student cohorts taught by a single regent; and the lack of land endowments as its source of income, which meant its faculty operated in a more competitive environment. Between 1750 and 1800, this system produced and attracted key Enlightenment figures such as chemist Joseph Black, economist Adam Smith, historian William Robertson, philosophers David Hume and Dugald Stewart, physician William Cullen, and early sociologist Adam Ferguson, many of which taught concurrently. By the time the Royal Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1783, the university was regarded as one of the world\\'s preeminent scientific institutions, and Voltaire called Edinburgh a \"hotbed of genius\" as a result. Benjamin Franklin believed that the university possessed \"a set of as truly great men, Professors of the Several Branches of Knowledge, as have ever appeared in any Age or Country\". Thomas Jefferson felt that as far as science was concerned, \"no place in the world can pretend to a competition with Edinburgh\".\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.3|The east facade of Old College facing onto South Bridge, as built in 1827. A dome similar to Adam\\'s original design was added in 1887 by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson.\\r\\nalt=piece of parchment of charter of novodamus from King James VI of Scotland in 1582|thumb|upright=1.3|A Charter of Novodamus from King James VI of Scotland in 1582, to establish a college\\r\\nIn 1785, Henry Dundas introduced the South Bridge Act in the House of Commons; one of the bill\\'s goals was to use South Bridge as a location for the university, which had existed in a hotchpotch of buildings since its establishment. The site was used to construct Old College, the university\\'s first custom-built building, by architect William Henry Playfair to plans by Robert Adam. During the 18th century, the university developed a particular forte in teaching anatomy and the developing science of surgery, and it was considered one of the best medical schools in the English-speaking world. Bodies to be used for dissection were brought to the university\\'s Anatomy Theatre through a secret tunnel from a nearby house (today\\'s College Wynd student accommodation), which was also used by murderers Burke and Hare to deliver the corpses of their victims during the 1820s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 275 years of governance by the town council, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858 gave the university full authority over its own affairs. The act established governing bodies including a university court and a general council, and redefined the roles of key officials like the chancellor, rector, and principal.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|Plaque commemorating the Edinburgh Seven at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Edinburgh Seven were the first group of matriculated undergraduate female students at any British university. Led by Sophia Jex-Blake, they began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1869. Although the university blocked them from graduating and qualifying as doctors, their campaign gained national attention and won them many supporters, including Charles Darwin. Their efforts put the rights of women to higher education on the national political agenda, which eventually resulted in legislation allowing women to study at all Scottish universities in 1889. The university admitted women to graduate in medicine in 1893. In 2015, the Edinburgh Seven were commemorated with a plaque at the university, and in 2019 they were posthumously awarded with medical degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Buildings of the Old Medical School at Teviot Place, photographed in the late 19th century\\r\\nthumb|left|Exterior of the McEwan Hall\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Old College was becoming overcrowded. After a bequest from Sir David Baxter, the university started planning new buildings in earnest. Sir Robert Rowand Anderson won the public architectural competition and was commissioned to design new premises for the Medical School in 1877. Initially, the design incorporated a campanile and a hall for examination and graduation, but this was seen as too ambitious. The new Medical School opened in 1884, but the building was not completed until 1888. After funds were donated by politician and brewer William McEwan in 1894, a separate graduation building was constructed after all, also designed by Anderson. The resulting McEwan Hall on Bristo Square was presented to the university in 1897.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Teviot Row House, drawn by architect Sydney Mitchell in 1888\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Students\\' Representative Council (SRC) was founded in 1884 by student Robert Fitzroy Bell. In 1889, the SRC voted to establish Edinburgh University Union (EUU), to be housed in Teviot Row House on Bristo Square. Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU) was founded in 1866, and Edinburgh University Women\\'s Union (renamed the Chambers Street Union in 1964) in October 1905. The SRC, EUU and Chambers Street Union merged to form Edinburgh University Students\\' Association (EUSA) on 1 July 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\n20th century\\r\\nDuring World War I, the Science and Medicine buildings had suffered from a lack of repairs or upgrades, which was exacerbated by an influx of students after the end of the war. In 1919, the university bought the land of West Mains Farm in the south of the city for the development of a new satellite campus specialising in the sciences. On 6 July 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the first new building (now called the Joseph Black Building), housing the Department of Chemistry. The campus was named King\\'s Buildings in honour of George V.\\r\\n\\r\\nleft|thumb|Facade of New College facing onto The Mound in 1910\\r\\n\\r\\nNew College on The Mound was originally opened in 1846 as a Free Church of Scotland college, later of the United Free Church of Scotland. Since the 1930s it has been the home of the School of Divinity. Prior to the 1929 reunion of the Church of Scotland, candidates for the ministry in the United Free Church studied at New College, whilst candidates for the Church of Scotland studied in the university\\'s Faculty of Divinity. In 1935 the two institutions merged, with all operations moved to the New College site in Old Town. This freed up Old College for Edinburgh Law School.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Plaque honouring the Polish School of Medicine at the old Medical School\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Polish School of Medicine was established in 1941 as a wartime academic initiative. While it was originally intended for students and doctors in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, civilians were also allowed to take the courses, which were taught in Polish and awarded Polish medical degrees. When the school was closed in 1949, 336 students had matriculated, of which 227 students graduated with the equivalent of an MBChB and a total of 19 doctors obtained a doctorate or MD. A bronze plaque commemorating the Polish School of Medicine is located in the Quadrangle of the old Medical School in Teviot Place.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 May 1951, the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College, founded in 1823 by William Dick, was reconstituted as the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and officially became part of the university. It achieved full faculty status as Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1964.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the 1950s, there were around 7,000 students matriculating annually, more than doubling the numbers from the turn of the century. The university addressed this partially through the redevelopment of George Square, demolishing much of the area\\'s historic houses and erecting modern buildings such as 40 George Square, Appleton Tower and the Main Library.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 August 1998, the Moray House Institute of Education, founded in 1848, merged with the University of Edinburgh, becoming its Faculty of Education. Following the internal restructuring of the university in 2002, Moray House became known as the Moray House School of Education. It was renamed the Moray House School of Education and Sport in August 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\n21st century\\r\\nIn the 1990s it became apparent that the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place were no longer adequate for a modern teaching hospital. Donald Dewar, the Scottish Secretary at the time, authorized a joint project between private finance, local authorities, and the university to create a modern hospital and medical campus in the Little France area of Edinburgh. The new campus was named the BioQuarter. The Chancellor\\'s Building was opened on 12 August 2002 by Prince Philip, housing the new Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald. In August 2010, author J. K. Rowling provided £10\\xa0million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, which was officially opened in October 2013. The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012. CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nleft|thumb|Atrium of the Informatics Forum\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2002, the Edinburgh Cowgate Fire destroyed a number of university buildings, including some  of the School of Informatics at 80 South Bridge. This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site. In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. In 2011, the school moved into a new £60\\xa0million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Edinburgh College of Art\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university\\'s School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011. In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English. The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016. The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3\\xa0billion Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region. The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the Data-Driven Innovation initiative. In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the Richard Verney Health Centre at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university\\'s disability and counselling services. The university\\'s largest current expansion project is the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120\\xa0million renovations and extension will provide space for the Edinburgh Futures Institute, an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of \\'complex futures\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical links\\r\\nEdinburgh has a number of historical links to other universities, chiefly through its influential Medical School and its graduates, who established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n College of William & Mary: the second-oldest college in the US was founded in 1693 by Edinburgh graduate James Blair, who served as the college\\'s founding president for fifty years.\\r\\n Columbia University: had its Medical School founded by Samuel Bard, an Edinburgh medical graduate.\\r\\n Dalhousie University: Edinburgh alumnus George Ramsay, the 22nd Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, wanted to establish a non-denominational college in Halifax open to all.

It is the university\\'s oldest area, occupied primarily by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Informatics. The highest concentration of university buildings is around George Square, which includes 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), Appleton Tower, Main Library, and Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre, the area\\'s largest lecture hall. Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences. The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students\\' Association\\'s main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston. North of George Square lies the university\\'s Old College housing Edinburgh Law School, New College on The Mound housing the School of Divinity, and St Cecilia\\'s Hall. Some of these buildings are used to host events during the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nPollock Halls\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|St Leonard\\'s Hall\\r\\n\\r\\nPollock Halls, adjoining Holyrood Park to the east, is the university\\'s largest residence hall for undergraduate students in their first year. The complex houses over 2,000 students during term time and consists of ten named buildings with communal green spaces between them. The two original buildings, St Leonard\\'s Hall and Salisbury Green, were built in the 19th century, while the majority of Pollock Halls dates from the 1960s and early 2000s. Two of the older houses in Pollock Halls were demolished in 2002, and a new building, Chancellor\\'s Court, was built in their place and opened in 2003. Self-catered flats elsewhere account for the majority of university-provided accommodation. The area also includes the John McIntyre Conference Centre opened in 2009, which is the university\\'s premier conference space.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolyrood\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Holyrood campus, just off the Royal Mile, used to be the site for Moray House Institute for Education until it merged with the university on 1 August 1998. The university has since extended this campus. The buildings include redeveloped and extended Sports Science, Physical Education and Leisure Management facilities at St Leonard\\'s Land linked to the Sports Institute in the Pleasance. The £80\\xa0million O\\'Shea Hall at Holyrood was named after the former principal of the university Sir Timothy O\\'Shea and was opened by Princess Anne in 2017, providing a living and social environment for postgraduate students. The Outreach Centre, Institute for Academic Development (University Services Group), and Edinburgh Centre for Professional Legal Studies are also located at Holyrood.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing\\'s Buildings\\r\\n\\r\\nleft|thumb|Royal Observatory, Edinburgh\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King\\'s Buildings campus is located in the south of the city. Most of the Science and Engineering College\\'s research and teaching activities take place at the campus, which occupies a 35-hectare site. It includes the Alexander Graham Bell Building (for mobile phones and digital communications systems), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and School of Mathematics), Joseph Black Building (home to the School of Chemistry), Royal Observatory, Swann Building (the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology), Waddington Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), William Rankine Building (School of Engineering\\'s Institute for Infrastructure and Environment), and others. Until 2012, the KB campus was served by three libraries: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library, and Robertson Engineering and Science Library. These were replaced by the Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the academic year 2012/13. The campus also hosts the National e-Science Centre (NeSC), Scotland\\'s Rural College (SRUC), Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), and Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC).\\r\\n\\r\\nBioQuarter\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|Edinburgh BioQuarter\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BioQuarter campus, based in the Little France area, is home to the majority of medical facilities of the university, alongside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The campus houses the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Chancellor\\'s Building, Euan MacDonald Centre, and Queen\\'s Medical Research Institute, which opened in 2005. The Chancellor\\'s Building has two large lecture theatres and a medical library connected to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by a series of corridors.\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster Bush\\r\\nThe Easter Bush campus, located seven miles south of the city, houses the Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education, Roslin Institute, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, and Veterinary Oncology and Imaging Centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Roslin Institute is an animal sciences research institute which is sponsored by BBSRC. The Institute won international fame in 1996, when its researchers Sir Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and their colleagues created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. A year later Polly and Molly were cloned, both sheep contained a human gene.\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern General\\r\\nThe Western General campus, in proximity to the Western General Hospital, contains the Biomedical Research Facility, Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility, and Institute of Genetics and Cancer (formerly the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine).\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganisation and administration\\r\\nGovernance\\r\\n\\r\\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966. These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the Senatus Academicus.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversity Court\\r\\nThe University Court is the university\\'s governing body and the legal person of the university, chaired by the rector and consisting of the principal, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of Assessors appointed by the rector, chancellor, Edinburgh Town Council, General Council, and Senatus Academicus. By the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, it is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. All property belonging to the university at the passing of the Act was vested in the Court. The present powers of the Court are further defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, including the administration and management of the university\\'s revenue and property, the regulation of staff salaries, and the establishment and composition of committees of its own members or others.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Council\\r\\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement. The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenatus Academicus\\r\\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university\\'s supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff. The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court. The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversity officials\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university\\'s three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels. The chancellor is elected by the university\\'s General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie. Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip. She is also Patron of the university\\'s Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court. The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students\\' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is human rights lawyer Debora Kayembe, who has held the position since March 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role. The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the Senatus Academicus and a member of the University Court ex officio. The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nColleges and schools\\r\\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three \\'Colleges\\'. While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are \\'Schools\\', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.\\r\\n\\r\\nArts, Humanities and Social Sciences\\r\\nright|thumb|Department of Psychology building at 7 George Square\\r\\nright|thumb|Elsie Inglis Quad at the Old Medical School, currently hosting the School of History, Classics and Archaeology\\r\\n\\r\\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011. CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes. Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 Complete University Guide. It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain, which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 QS Rankings by Subject in English Language & Literature. The college hosts Scotland\\'s ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicine and Veterinary Medicine\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|Members of the medical faculty at Edinburgh in the first half of the 19th century.

Traill.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh Medical School was widely considered the best medical school in the English-speaking world throughout the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century and contributed significantly to the university\\'s international reputation. Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 21st century, the medical school has continued to excel, and it is associated with 13 Nobel Prize recipients: seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and six of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2021, it was ranked third in the UK by The Times University Guide, and the Complete University Guide. In 2022, it was ranked the UK\\'s best medical school by the Guardian University Guide,  It also ranked 21st in the world by both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings in 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is a world leader in veterinary education, research and practice. The eight original faculties formed four Faculty Groups in August 1992. Medicine and Veterinary Medicine became one of these, and in 2002 became the smallest of the three colleges, with 7,740 students and 1,896 academic staff. The university\\'s teaching hospitals include the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, St John\\'s Hospital, Livingston, Roodlands Hospital, and Royal Hospital for Children and Young People.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience and Engineering\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|Old Surgical Hospital in Drummond Street, once part of the Royal Infirmary, today houses the university\\'s Institute of Geography.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as \"natural philosophy\" in the university. The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture. It was Edinburgh\\'s professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world\\'s first Chemical Society in 1785. The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh. The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871. In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering. The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nSub-units, centres and institutes\\r\\nthumb|Edinburgh Futures Institute taking shape on the former site of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh\\r\\n\\r\\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n Staff, Community and Networking \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2023, the University employed over 11,800 full time equivalent staff:Staff Population Statistics.

However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcademic profile\\r\\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the Sutton 13 group of top-ranked universities in the UK. It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities. The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research. Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmissions\\r\\n+ Undergraduate admission statistics 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Applications 75,438 68,954 62,220 60,983 58,411 Offers 25,210 32,432 31,510 27,878 25,532 Offer Rate (%) 33.0 47.0 50.6 45.7 43.7 Enrolls 6,111 8,083 7,344 6,346 6,221 Yield (%) 24.2 24.9 23.3 22.8 24.4 Applicant/Enrolled Ratio 12.34 8.53 8.47 9.61 9.39 Average Entry Tariff  197 190 186 187\\r\\nHESA Student Body CompositionDomicile and EthnicityTotalBritish White British Ethnic Minorities International EU International Non-EU Undergraduate Widening Participation IndicatorsFemale Private School Low Participation Areas \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades.

As of August 2021, it has a higher proportion of female than male students with a male to female ratio of 38:62 in the undergraduate population, and the undergraduate student body is composed of 30% Scottish students, 32% from the rest of the UK, 10% from the EU, and 28% from outside the EU.\\r\\n\\r\\nGraduation\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Edinburgh graduation ceremony in the McEwan Hall\\r\\n\\r\\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being \\'capped\\' with the Geneva bonnet, which involves the university\\'s principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate. The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan. However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat. In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the Geneva bonnet.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibrary system\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Playfair Library Hall in Old College\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland. The Brutalist style eight-storey Main Library building in George Square was designed by Sir Basil Spence. At the time of its completion in 1967, it was the largest building of its type in the UK, and today is a category A listed building. The library system also includes many specialised libraries at the college and school level.\\r\\n\\r\\nExchange programmes\\r\\nthumb|The former principal Sir Timothy O\\'Shea signed an agreement with Peking University in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university offers students the opportunity to study in Europe and beyond via the European Union\\'s Erasmus+ programme and a variety of international exchange agreements with around 300 partners institutions in nearly 40 countries worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversity-wide exchanges are open to almost any student whose degree permits a year abroad and who can find a suitable course combination.

The university fell four places in GPA when compared to the 2014 REF, but retained its place in research power. 90 per cent of the university\\'s research activity was judged to be \\'world leading\\' (4*) or \\'internationally excellent\\' (3*), and five departments – Computer Science, Informatics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Development Studies – were ranked as the best in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2015 THE Global Employability University Ranking, Edinburgh ranked 23rd in the world and 4th in the UK for graduate employability as voted by international recruiters. A 2015 government report found that Edinburgh was one of only two Scottish universities (along with St Andrews) that some London-based elite recruitment firms considered applicants from, especially in the field of financial services and investment banking. When The New York Times ranked universities based on the employability of graduates as evaluated by recruiters from top companies in 20 countries in 2012, Edinburgh was placed at 42nd in the world and 7th in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh was ranked 24th in the world and 5th in the UK by the 2021 Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities, a league table based on the three major world university rankings, ARWU, QS and THE.  In the 2022 U.S. News & World Report, Edinburgh ranked 32nd globally and 5th nationally. The 2022 World Reputation Rankings placed Edinburgh at 32nd worldwide and 5th nationwide. In 2023, it ranked 73rd amongst the universities around the world by the SCImago Institutions Rankings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disparity between Edinburgh\\'s research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely due to the impact of measures of \\'student satisfaction\\'. Edinburgh was ranked last in the UK for teaching quality in the 2012 National Student Survey, with the 2015 Good University Guide stating that this stemmed from \"questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback\", and that the university \"still has a long way to go to turn around a poor position\". Edinburgh improved only marginally over the next years, with the 2021 Good University Guide still ranking it in the bottom 10 domestically in both teaching quality and student experience. Edinburgh was ranked 122nd out of 128 universities for student satisfaction in the 2022 Complete University Guide, although it was ranked 12th overall. The 2024 Guardian University Guide ranked Edinburgh 14th overall, but 50th out of 120 universities in teaching satisfaction, and lowest among all universities in satisfaction with feedback.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2022 Complete University Guide, 32 out of the 49 subjects offered by Edinburgh were ranked within the top 10 in the UK, with Asian Studies (4th), Chemical Engineering (4th), Education (2nd), Geology (5th), Linguistics (5th), Mechanical Engineering (5th), Medicine (5th), Music (5th), Nursing (1st), Physics & Astronomy (5th), Social Policy (5th), Theology & Religious Studies (4th), and Veterinary Medicine (2nd) within the top 5. The 2021 THE World University Rankings by Subject ranked Edinburgh 10th worldwide in Arts and Humanities, 15th in Law, 16th in Psychology, 21st in Clinical, Pre-clinical & Health, 22nd in Computer Science, 28th in Education, 28th in Life Science, 43rd in Business & Economics, 44th in Social Sciences, 45th in Physical Sciences, and 86th in Engineering & Technology. The 2023 QS World University Rankings by Subject placed Edinburgh at 10th globally in Arts & Humanities, 23rd in Life Sciences & Medicine, 36th in Natural Sciences, 50th in Social Sciences & Management, and 59th in Engineering & Technology. According to CSRankings, computer science at Edinburgh was ranked 1st in the UK and 36th globally, and Edinburgh was the best in natural language processing (NLP) in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent life\\r\\nStudents\\' Association\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The Pleasance, one of EUSA\\'s main buildings, is a theatre, bar, sports and recreation complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh University Students\\' Association (EUSA) consists of the students\\' union and the students\\' representative council. EUSA\\'s buildings include Teviot Row House, The Pleasance, Potterrow Student Centre, Kings Buildings House, as well as shops, cafés and refectories across the various campuses.

The modern city is located between the rivers Almond and Esk on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth, in the historic region of Lothian, bounded on its southern side by the Pentland Hills. Edinburgh is Scotland\\'s second most populous city and the seventh most populous city in the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, and the highest courts in Scotland. The city\\'s Palace of Holyroodhouse is the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. It is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, fourth largest in Europe and thirteenth largest internationallyhttps://scottishfinancialreview.com/2020/09/25/edinburgh-4th-in-europe-in-new-financial-centres-index/ and the city\\'s historical and cultural attractions have made it the UK\\'s second-most visited tourist destination, attracting 4.9 million visits, including 2.4 million from overseas in 2018. Time Out magazine rated Edinburgh the best city in the world in 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh\\'s official population estimates are  (mid-2020) for the locality,  (mid-2019) for the City of Edinburgh council area, which takes in some outlying villages in the western part of its territory, and 1,384,950 (2019) for the wider Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region which also includes East Lothian, Fife, Midlothian, the Scottish Borders and West Lothian. The City of Edinburgh Council is the current local authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It is home to national cultural institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world, most recently placing 15th in the QS World University Rankings for 2023. The city is also known for the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, the latter being the world\\'s largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the churches of St. Giles, Greyfriars and the Canongate, and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th/19th centuries. Edinburgh\\'s Old Town and New Town together are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which has been managed by Edinburgh World Heritage since 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nEtymology\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Edin\", the root of the city\\'s name, derives from , the name for the region in Cumbric, the Brittonic Celtic language formerly spoken there. The name\\'s meaning is unknown. The district of Eidyn was centred on the stronghold of Din Eidyn, the dun or hillfort of Eidyn. This stronghold is believed to have been located at Castle Rock, now the site of Edinburgh Castle. A siege of Din Eidyn by Oswald, king of the Angles of Northumbria in 638 marked the beginning of three centuries of Germanic influence in south east Scotland that laid the foundations for the development of Scots, before the town was ultimately subsumed in 954 by the kingdom known to the English as Scotland. As the language shifted from Cumbric to Northumbrian Old English and then Scots, the Brittonic din in Din Eidyn was replaced by burh, producing Edinburgh. In Scottish Gaelic din becomes dùn, producing modern Dùn Èideann.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicknames\\r\\nthumb|Surgeons\\' Hall, one of the Greek Revival buildings that earned Edinburgh the nickname \"Athens of the North\"\\r\\nThe city is affectionately nicknamed Auld Reekie, Scots for Old Smoky, for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town. In Walter Scott\\'s 1820 novel The Abbot, a character observes that \"yonder stands Auld Reekie—you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles\\' distance\". In 1898, Thomas Carlyle comments on the phenomenon: \"Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh, for, ever since Aeneas Silvius\\'s time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called \\'Auld Reekie\\' by the country people\". 19th-century historian Robert Chambers argued that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of Charles II in the late 17th century. Instead, he attributed the name to a Fife laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. \"It\\'s time now bairns, to tak\\' the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder\\'s Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht -cap!\".\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh has been popularly called the Athens of the North since the early 19th century. References to Athens, such as Athens of Britain and Modern Athens, had been made as early as the 1760s. The similarities were seen to be topographical but also intellectual. Edinburgh\\'s Castle Rock reminded returning grand tourists of the Athenian Acropolis, as did aspects of the neoclassical architecture and layout of New Town. Both cities had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a port several miles away (respectively, Leith and Piraeus). Intellectually, the Scottish Enlightenment, with its humanist and rationalist outlook, was influenced by Ancient Greek philosophy. In 1822, artist Hugh William Williams organized an exhibition that showed his paintings of Athens alongside views of Edinburgh, and the idea of a direct parallel between both cities quickly caught the popular imagination. When plans were drawn up in the early 19th century to architecturally develop Calton Hill, the design of the National Monument directly copied Athens\\' Parthenon. Tom Stoppard\\'s character Archie of Jumpers said, perhaps playing on Reykjavík meaning \"smoky bay\", that the \"Reykjavík of the South\" would be more appropriate.Stoppard, Tom. Jumpers, Grove Press, 1972, p. 69.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city has also been known by several Latin names, such as Edinburgum, while the adjectival forms Edinburgensis and Edinensis are used in educational and scientific contexts.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdina is a late 18th-century poetical form used by the Scots poets Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns. \"Embra\" or \"Embro\" are colloquialisms from the same time, as in Robert Garioch\\'s Embro to the Ploy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Jonson described it as \"Britaine\\'s other eye\",The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson . Retrieved 17 April 2007. and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as \"yon Empress of the North\".Marmion A Tale of Flodden Field by Walter Scott . Retrieved 17 April 2007. Robert Louis Stevenson, also a son of the city, wrote that Edinburgh \"is what Paris ought to be\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly history\\r\\nthumb|right|Edinburgh, showing Arthur\\'s Seat, one of the earliest known sites of human habitation in the area\\r\\nThe earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was at Cramond, where evidence was found of a Mesolithic camp site dated to c. 8500 BC. Traces of later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements have been found on Castle Rock, Arthur\\'s Seat, Craiglockhart Hill and the Pentland Hills.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Romans arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a Brittonic Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the Votadini. The Votadini transitioned into the Gododdin kingdom in the Early Middle Ages, with Eidyn serving as one of the kingdom\\'s districts. During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdom\\'s major centre. The medieval poem Y Gododdin describes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 638, the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to King Oswald of Northumbria, and around this time control of Lothian passed to the Angles. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign of Indulf, son of Constantine II, the \"burh\" (fortress), named in the 10th-century Pictish Chronicle as oppidum Eden, was abandoned to the Scots. It thenceforth remained, for the most part, under their jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe royal burgh was founded by King David I in the early 12th century on land belonging to the Crown, though the date of its charter is unknown. The first documentary evidence of the medieval burgh is a royal charter, , by King David I granting a toft in  to the Priory of Dunfermline. The shire of Edinburgh seems to have also been created in the reign of David I, possibly covering all of Lothian at first, but by 1305 the eastern and western parts of Lothian had become Haddingtonshire and Linlithgowshire, leaving Edinburgh as the county town of a shire covering the central part of Lothian, which was called Edinburghshire or Midlothian (the latter name being an informal, but commonly used, alternative until the county\\'s name was legally changed in 1947).\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh was largely in English hands from 1291 to 1314 and from 1333 to 1341, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. When the English invaded Scotland in 1298, King Edward I chose not to enter the English controlled town of Edinburgh but passed by with his army.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the 14th century, the French chronicler Jean Froissart described it as the capital of Scotland (c. 1365), and James III (1451–88) referred to it in the 15th century as \"the principal burgh of our kingdom\". In 1482 James III \"granted and perpetually confirmed to the said Provost, Bailies, Clerk, Council, and Community, and their successors, the office of Sheriff within the Burgh for ever, to be exercised by the Provost for the time as Sheriff, and by the Bailies for the time as Sheriffsdepute conjunctly and severally; with full power to hold Courts, to punish transgressors not only by banishment but by death, to appoint officers of Court, and to do everything else appertaining to the office of Sheriff; as also to apply to their own proper use the fines and escheats arising out of the exercise of the said office.\" Despite the destruction caused by an English assault in 1544, the town slowly recovered, and was at the centre of events in the 16th-century Scottish Reformation and 17th-century Wars of the Covenant. In 1582, Edinburgh\\'s town council was given a royal charter by King James VI permitting the establishment of a university; founded as Tounis College (Town\\'s College), the institution developed into the University of Edinburgh, which contributed to Edinburgh\\'s central intellectual role in subsequent centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\n17th century\\r\\nthumb|left|Edinburgh in the 17th century\\r\\nthumb|right|Edinburgh, around 1690\\r\\nIn 1603, King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England in a personal union known as the Union of the Crowns, though Scotland remained, in all other respects, a separate kingdom. In 1638, King Charles I\\'s attempt to introduce Anglican church forms in Scotland encountered stiff Presbyterian opposition culminating in the conflicts of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Subsequent Scottish support for Charles Stuart\\'s restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh\\'s occupation by Oliver Cromwell\\'s Commonwealth of England forces – the New Model Army – in 1650.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 17th century, Edinburgh\\'s boundaries were still defined by the city\\'s defensive town walls. As a result, the city\\'s growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common, and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper. Most of these old structures were replaced by the predominantly Victorian buildings seen in today\\'s Old Town. In 1611 an act of parliament created the High Constables of Edinburgh to keep order in the city, thought to be the oldest statutory police force in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n18th century\\r\\nthumb|A painting showing Edinburgh characters (based on John Kay\\'s caricatures) behind St Giles\\' Cathedral in the late 18th century\\r\\nFollowing the Treaty of Union in 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed Acts of Union in 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in the Kingdom of Great Britain effective from 1 May 1707. As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London. The Union was opposed by many Scots, resulting in riots in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the first half of the 18th century, Edinburgh was described as one of Europe\\'s most densely populated, overcrowded and unsanitary towns. Visitors were struck by the fact that the social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same tenement buildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1745, Edinburgh was briefly occupied by the Jacobite \"Highland Army\" before its march into England. After its eventual defeat at Culloden, there followed a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the rebellious clans.--These clans were mainly Episcopalian (70 per cent) and Roman Catholic (30 per cent), p.151. In Edinburgh, the Town Council, keen to emulate London by initiating city improvements and expansion to the north of the castle, reaffirmed its belief in the Union and loyalty to the Hanoverian monarch George III by its choice of names for the streets of the New Town: for example, Rose Street and Thistle Street; and for the royal family, George Street, Queen Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Princes Street (in honour of George\\'s two sons). The consistently geometric layout of the plan for the extension of Edinburgh was the result of a major competition in urban planning staged by the Town Council in 1766.Alexis Joachimides, \"Edinburgh\\'s First New Town from a Transnational Perspective – Continental Sources for Eighteenth-Century Town Planning in Britain\", in Maria Effinger, et al. (eds.), Von analogen und digitalen Zugängen zur Kunst: Festschrift für Hubertus Kohle zum 60. Geburtstag (Heidelberg University: arthistoricum.net, 2019), pp. 71–82.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of the century, the city was at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment, when thinkers like David Hume, Adam Smith, James Hutton and Joseph Black were familiar figures in its streets. Edinburgh became a major intellectual centre, earning it the nickname \"Athens of the North\" because of its many neo-classical buildings and reputation for learning, recalling ancient Athens. In the 18th-century novel The Expedition of Humphry Clinker by Tobias Smollett one character describes Edinburgh as a \"hotbed of genius\". Edinburgh was also a major centre for the Scottish book trade. The highly successful London bookseller Andrew Millar was apprenticed there to James McEuen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant \"one-family\" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city\\'s social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, \"Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n19th and 20th centuries\\r\\nthumb|left|Edinburgh Castle from the Grassmarket, photographed by George Washington Wilson circa 1875\\r\\n\\r\\nalt=An aerial photo of Edinburgh with an aeroplane visible|thumb|Edinburgh, c. 1920\\r\\nDespite an enduring myth to the contrary, Edinburgh became an industrial centre with its traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continuing to grow in the 19th century and joined by new industries such as rubber works, engineering works and others. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken by Glasgow as Scotland\\'s largest city. The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates. Improvements carried out under Lord Provost William Chambers in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly Victorian Old Town seen today. More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of Patrick Geddes, but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major slum clearance in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed the George Square and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1990s a new \"financial district\", including the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into Fountainbridge, a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the United Kingdom\\'s second largest financial and administrative centre after London. Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city. The development of Edinburgh Park, a new business and technology park covering ,  west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Council\\'s strategy for the city\\'s major economic regeneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, the Scotland Act, which came into force the following year, established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since September 2007). Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while reserved matters such as defence, foreign affairs and some elements of income tax remain the responsibility of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n21st century\\r\\nIn 2022, Edinburgh was affected by the 2022 Scotland bin strikes. In 2023, Edinburgh became the first capital city in Europe to sign the global Plant Based Treaty, which was introduced at COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow. Green Party councillor Steve Burgess introduced the treaty. The Scottish Countryside Alliance and other farming groups called the treaty \"anti-farming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGeography\\r\\nCityscape\\r\\nSituated in Scotland\\'s Central Belt, Edinburgh lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. The city centre is  southwest of the shoreline of Leith and  inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the North Sea at Dunbar. While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on seven hills, namely Calton Hill, Corstorphine Hill, Craiglockhart Hill, Braid Hill, Blackford Hill, Arthur\\'s Seat and the Castle Rock, giving rise to allusions to the seven hills of Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the Pentland Hills and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.\\r\\n Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago, coupled with faulting, led to the creation of tough basalt volcanic plugs, which predominate over much of the area. One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing ice sheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a  tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive crag and tail formation. Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained Nor Loch. These features, along with another hollow on the rock\\'s south side, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built. Similarly, Arthur\\'s Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the Carboniferous period, which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age. Erosive action such as plucking and abrasion exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east. This process formed the distinctive Salisbury Crags, a series of teschenite cliffs between Arthur\\'s Seat and the location of the early burgh. The residential areas of Marchmont and Bruntsfield are built along a series of drumlin ridges south of the city centre, which were deposited as the glacier receded.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther prominent landforms such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill are also products of glacial erosion. The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south of the city centre that command expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Firth of Forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=3.2|center|View of Edinburgh from Blackford Hill\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh is drained by the river named the Water of Leith, which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for  through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith. The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at Dean Village on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by Thomas Telford\\'s Dean Bridge, built in 1832 for the road to Queensferry. The Water of Leith Walkway is a mixed-use trail that follows the course of the river for  from Balerno to Leith.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt, designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny in the west to Prestongrange in the east. With an average width of  the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone. Similarly, suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAreas\\r\\nEdinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Many areas, such as Dalry, contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as tenements, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of Princes Street Gardens. To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh\\'s Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 listed buildings within the city, a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it terminating at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or wynds) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest \"high rise\" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as lands were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys. Numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly Irish immigrants, during the Industrial Revolution. The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles\\' Cathedral, the City Chambers and the Law Courts. Other places of historical interest nearby are Greyfriars Kirkyard and Mary King\\'s Close. The Grassmarket, running deep below the castle is connected by the steep double terraced Victoria Street. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many Northern European cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a \"New Town\" was won by James Craig, a 27-year-old architect. The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with Enlightenment ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be George Street, running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the \"Old Town\". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh\\'s main shopping street and now has few of its Georgian buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by St Andrew Square and Charlotte Square respectively. The latter, designed by Robert Adam, influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century. Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, is on the north side of Charlotte Square.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the Nor Loch, which was created for the town\\'s defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their sewage. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city\\'s northward expansion. Craig\\'s original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch, but this idea was abandoned. Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the loch to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as The Mound.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the 19th century the National Gallery of Scotland and Royal Scottish Academy Building were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between Haymarket and Waverley stations were driven through it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southside is a residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, Marchmont, Morningside, Newington, Sciennes, the Grange and Blackford. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the Burgh Muir, and was developed as a residential area after the opening of the South Bridge in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around George Square just north of Marchmont and the Meadows), and Napier University (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and \"bed and breakfast\" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, Church Hill in Morningside, was the home of Muriel Spark\\'s Miss Jean Brodie, and Ian Rankin\\'s Inspector Rebus lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The Shore, Leith\\r\\n\\r\\nLeith was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329. The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh. Even today the parliamentary seat is known as \"Edinburgh North and Leith\". The loss of traditional industries and commerce (the last shipyard closed in 1983) resulted in economic decline. The Edinburgh Waterfront development has transformed old dockland areas from Leith to Granton into residential areas with shopping and leisure facilities and helped rejuvenate the area. With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coastal suburb of Portobello is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a beach and promenade and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs and a restored Victorian swimming pool, including Turkish baths.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe urban area of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the City of Edinburgh Council boundary, merging with Musselburgh in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include Haddington, Tranent, Prestonpans, Dalkeith, Bonnyrigg, Loanhead, Penicuik, Broxburn, Livingston and Dunfermline. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh & South East Scotland City region with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate\\r\\nLike most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a cool, temperate, maritime climate which, despite its northerly latitude, is milder than places which lie at similar latitudes such as Moscow and Labrador. The city\\'s proximity to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing while summer temperatures are moderate, rarely exceeding . The highest temperature recorded in the city was  on 25 July 2019 at Gogarbank, beating the previous record of  on 4 August 1975 at Edinburgh Airport. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was  during December 2010 at Gogarbank.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven Edinburgh\\'s position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as \"the windy city\", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the North Atlantic Current that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by haar, a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as European windstorms, can affect the city between October and May.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated slightly north of the city centre, the weather station at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) has been an official weather station for the Met Office since 1956.\\r\\nThe Met Office operates its own weather station at Gogarbank on the city\\'s western outskirts, near Edinburgh Airport. This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTemperature and rainfall records have been kept at the Royal Observatory since 1764.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemography\\r\\nthumb|Population pyramid of Edinburgh (local authority area) in 2020\\r\\nCurrent\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.3|Population density map\\r\\nThe most recent official population estimates (2020) are  for the locality (includes Currie),  for the Edinburgh settlement (includes Musselburgh).\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh\\'s population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion of White Scottish-born fell from 78% to 70%. Of those Edinburgh residents born in the UK, 335,000 or 83% were born in Scotland, with 58,000 or 14% being born in England. \\r\\nEthnic Group1991As UK Census data post 2001 is unavailable through the ONS website, it has been recommended to use archival census collection websites to obtain data.

Of the Non-White population, the largest group by far are Asian, totalling 26,264 people. Within the Asian population, people of Chinese descent are now the largest sub-group, with 8,076 people, amounting to about 1.7% of the city\\'s total population. The city\\'s population of Indian descent amounts to 6,470 (1.4% of the total population), while there are some 5,858 of Pakistani descent (1.2% of the total population). Although they account for only 1,277 people or 0.3% of the city\\'s population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of people of Bangladeshi descent in Scotland. Over 7,000 people were born in African countries (1.6% of the total population) and nearly 7,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 3,700) than any other city in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proportion of people born outside the UK was 15.9% compared with 8% in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\n Place of birth Estimated resident population (2011)  11,651  4,888  4,743   4,188  3,700  3,500  2,472  2,100  2,000  2,000  1,800  1,800  1,600\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical\\r\\n\\r\\nA census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas. As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped tenements that lined the present day Royal Mile and the Cowgate, were exacerbated. Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease, with outbreaks of cholera occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.\\r\\n Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to Victorian suburbs such as Dalry, Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh\\'s population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as Dumbiedykes, Leith, and Fountainbridge, led to the creation of new estates such as Stenhouse and Saughton, Craigmillar and Niddrie, Pilton and Muirhouse, Piershill, and Sighthill.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion\\r\\nthumb|left|The High Kirk of Edinburgh, also known as St Giles\\' Cathedral\\r\\nIn 2018, the Church of Scotland had 20,956 members in 71 congregations in the Presbytery of Edinburgh. Its most prominent church is St Giles\\' on the Royal Mile, first dedicated in 1243 but believed to date from before the 12th century. Saint Giles is historically the patron saint of Edinburgh. St Cuthbert\\'s, situated at the west end of Princes Street Gardens in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle and St Giles\\' can lay claim to being the oldest Christian sites in the city, though the present St Cuthbert\\'s, designed by Hippolyte Blanc, was dedicated in 1894.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Church of Scotland churches include Greyfriars Kirk, the Canongate Kirk, St Andrew\\'s and St George\\'s West Church and the Barclay Church. The Church of Scotland Offices are in Edinburgh, as is the Assembly Hall where the annual General Assembly is held.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh has 27 parishes across the city. The Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh has his official residence in Greenhill, the diocesan offices are in nearby Marchmont, and its cathedral is St Mary\\'s Cathedral, Edinburgh. The Diocese of Edinburgh of the Scottish Episcopal Church has over 50 churches, half of them in the city. Its centre is the late 19th-century Gothic style St Mary\\'s Cathedral in the West End\\'s Palmerston Place. Orthodox Christianity is represented by Pan, Romanian and Russian Orthodox churches. There are several independent churches in the city, both Catholic and Protestant, including Charlotte Chapel, Carrubbers Christian Centre, Bellevue Chapel and Sacred Heart. There are also churches belonging to Quakers, Christadelphians, Seventh-day Adventists, Church of Christ, Scientist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Elim Pentecostal Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuslims have several places of worship across the city. Edinburgh Central Mosque, the largest Islamic place of worship, is located in Potterrow on the city\\'s Southside, near Bristo Square. Construction was largely financed by a gift from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and was completed in 1998. There is also an Ahmadiyya Muslim community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded presence of a Jewish community in Edinburgh dates back to the late 18th century. Edinburgh\\'s Orthodox synagogue, opened in 1932, is in Salisbury Road and can accommodate a congregation of 2000. A Liberal Jewish congregation also meets in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Sikh gurdwara and a Hindu mandir are located in Leith. The city also has a Brahma Kumaris centre in the Polwarth area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Edinburgh Buddhist Centre, run by the Triratna Buddhist Community, formerly situated in Melville Terrace, now runs sessions at the Healthy Life Centre, Bread Street. Other Buddhist traditions are represented by groups which meet in the capital: the Community of Interbeing (followers of Thich Nhat Hanh), Rigpa, Samye Dzong, Theravadin, Pure Land and Shambala. There is a Sōtō Zen Priory in Portobello and a Theravadin Thai Buddhist Monastery in Slateford Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh is home to a Baháʼí community, and a Theosophical Society meets in Great King Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh has an Inter-Faith Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh has over 39 graveyards and cemeteries, many of which are listed and of historical character, including several former church burial grounds. Examples include Old Calton Burial Ground, Greyfriars Kirkyard and Dean Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomy\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|The Bank of Scotland\\'s head office in central Edinburgh\\r\\nEdinburgh has the strongest economy of any city in the United Kingdom outside London and the highest percentage of professionals in the UK with 43% of the population holding a degree-level or professional qualification. According to the Centre for International Competitiveness, it is the most competitive large city in the United Kingdom. It also has the highest gross value added per employee of any city in the UK outside London, measuring £57,594 in 2010. It was named European Best Large City of the Future for Foreign Direct Investment and Best Large City for Foreign Direct Investment Strategy in the Financial Times fDi magazine awards 2012/13.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 19th century, Edinburgh\\'s economy was known for banking and insurance, publishing and printing, and brewing and distilling. Today, its economy is based mainly on financial services, scientific research, higher education, and tourism. In March 2010, unemployment in Edinburgh was comparatively low at 3.6%, and it remains consistently below the Scottish average of 4.5%. Edinburgh is the second most visited city by foreign visitors in the UK after London.\\r\\n\\r\\nBanking has been a mainstay of the Edinburgh economy for over 300 years, since the Bank of Scotland was established by an act of the Scottish Parliament in 1695. Today, the financial services industry, with its particularly strong insurance and investment sectors, and underpinned by Edinburgh-based firms such as Scottish Widows and Standard Life Aberdeen, accounts for the city being the UK\\'s second financial centre after London and Europe\\'s fourth in terms of equity assets. The NatWest Group (formerly Royal Bank of Scotland Group) opened new global headquarters at Gogarburn in the west of the city in October 2005. The city is home to the headquarters of Bank of Scotland, Sainsbury\\'s Bank, Tesco Bank, and TSB Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Edinburgh Park\\r\\n\\r\\nTourism is also an important element in the city\\'s economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August each year during the Edinburgh Festivals, which attracts 4.4\\xa0million visitors, and generates over £100M for the local economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the centre of Scotland\\'s government and legal system, the public sector plays a central role in Edinburgh\\'s economy. Many departments of the Scottish Government are in the city. Other major employers include NHS Scotland and local government administration. When the £1.3bn Edinburgh & South East Scotland City Region Deal was signed in 2018, the region\\'s Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution to the Scottish economy was cited as £33bn, or 33% of the country\\'s output. The City Region Deal funds a range of \"Data Driven Innovation\" hubs which are using data to innovate in the region, recognising the region\\'s strengths in technology and data science, the growing importance of the data economy, and the need to tackle the digital skills gap, as a route to social and economic prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture\\r\\nFestivals and celebrations\\r\\nEdinburgh festival\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city hosts a series of festivals that run between the end of July and early September each year. The best known of these events are the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the Edinburgh Art Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|Pipers emerging from Edinburgh Castle during the Edinburgh Military Tattoo\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest established of these festivals is the Edinburgh International Festival, which was first held in 1947 and consists mainly of a programme of high-profile theatre productions and classical music performances, featuring international directors, conductors, theatre companies and orchestras.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has since been overtaken in size by the Edinburgh Fringe which began as a programme of marginal acts alongside the \"official\" Festival and has become the world\\'s largest performing arts festival. In 2017, nearly 3400 different shows were staged in 300 venues across the city. Comedy has become one of the mainstays of the Fringe, with numerous well-known comedians getting their first \\'break\\' there, often by being chosen to receive the Edinburgh Comedy Award. The Edinburgh Military Tattoo, occupies the Castle Esplanade every night for three weeks each August, with massed pipe bands and military bands drawn from around the world. Performances end with a short fireworks display.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the summer festivals, many other festivals are held during the rest of the year, including the Edinburgh International Film Festival and Edinburgh International Science Festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summer of 2020 was the first time in its 70-year history that the Edinburgh festival was not run, being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This affected many of the tourist-focused businesses in Edinburgh which depend on the various festivals over summer to return an annual profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh\\'s Hogmanay\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|A Viking longship being burnt during Edinburgh\\'s annual Hogmanay celebrations\\r\\nThe annual Edinburgh Hogmanay celebration was originally an informal street party focused on the Tron Kirk in the Old Town\\'s High Street. Since 1993, it has been officially organised with the focus moved to Princes Street. In 1996, over 300,000 people attended, leading to ticketing of the main street party in later years up to a limit of 100,000 tickets. Hogmanay now covers four days of processions, concerts and fireworks, with the street party beginning on Hogmanay. Alternative tickets are available for entrance into the Princes Street Gardens concert and Cèilidh, where well-known artists perform and ticket holders can participate in traditional Scottish cèilidh dancing. The event attracts thousands of people from all over the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeltane and other festivals\\r\\nOn the night of 30 April the Beltane Fire Festival takes place on Calton Hill, involving a procession followed by scenes inspired by pagan old spring fertility celebrations. At the beginning of October each year the Dussehra Hindu Festival is also held on Calton Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic, theatre and film\\r\\nthumb|left|Edinburgh Festival Theatre\\r\\nOutside the Festival season, Edinburgh supports several theatres and production companies. The Royal Lyceum Theatre has its own company, while the King\\'s Theatre, Edinburgh Festival Theatre and Edinburgh Playhouse stage large touring shows. The Traverse Theatre presents a more contemporary repertoire. Amateur theatre companies productions are staged at the Bedlam Theatre, Church Hill Theatre and King\\'s Theatre among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Usher Hall is Edinburgh\\'s premier venue for classical music, as well as occasional popular music concerts. It was the venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 1972. Other halls staging music and theatre include The Hub, the Assembly Rooms and the Queen\\'s Hall. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra is based in Edinburgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright|Traverse Theatre\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh has one repertory cinema, The Cameo, and formerly, the Edinburgh Filmhouse as well as the independent Dominion Cinema and a range of multiplexes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh has a healthy popular music scene. Occasionally large concerts are staged at Murrayfield and Meadowbank, while mid-sized events take place at smaller venues such as \\'The Corn Exchange\\', \\'The Liquid Rooms\\' and \\'The Bongo Club\\'. In 2010, PRS for Music listed Edinburgh among the UK\\'s top ten \\'most musical\\' cities. Several city pubs are well known for their live performances of folk music. They include \\'Sandy Bell\\'s\\' in Forrest Road, \\'Captain\\'s Bar\\' in South College Street and \\'Whistlebinkies\\' in South Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many other cities in the UK, numerous nightclub venues host Electronic dance music events.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh is home to a flourishing group of contemporary composers such as Nigel Osborne, Peter Nelson, Lyell Cresswell, Hafliði Hallgrímsson, Edward Harper, Robert Crawford, Robert Dow and John McLeod. McLeod\\'s music is heard regularly on BBC Radio 3 and throughout the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedia\\r\\nNewspapers\\r\\nThe main local newspaper is the Edinburgh Evening News. It is owned and published alongside its sister titles The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday by JPIMedia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio\\r\\nThe city has two commercial radio stations: Forth 1, a station which broadcasts mainstream chart music, and Forth 2 on medium wave which plays classic hits. Capital Scotland, Heart Scotland and Eklipse Sports Radio also have transmitters covering Edinburgh. Along with the UK national radio stations, BBC Radio Scotland and the Gaelic language service BBC Radio nan Gàidheal are also broadcast. DAB digital radio is broadcast over two local multiplexes. BFBS Radio broadcasts from studios on the base at Dreghorn Barracks across the city on 98.5FM as part of its UK Bases network. Small scale DAB started October 2022 with numerous community stations onboard\\r\\n\\r\\nTelevision\\r\\nTelevision, along with most radio services, is broadcast to the city from the Craigkelly transmitting station situated in Fife on the opposite side of the Firth of Forth and the Black Hill transmitting station in North Lanarkshire to the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no television stations based in the city. Edinburgh Television existed in the late 1990s to early 2003 and STV Edinburgh existed from 2015 to 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuseums, libraries and galleries\\r\\nthumb|left|National Gallery of Scotland\\r\\nEdinburgh has many museums and libraries. These include the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland, National War Museum, the Museum of Edinburgh, Surgeons\\' Hall Museum, the Writers\\' Museum, the Museum of Childhood and Dynamic Earth. The Museum on The Mound has exhibits on money and banking.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh Zoo, covering  on Corstorphine Hill, is the second most visited paid tourist attraction in Scotland, and home to two giant pandas, Tian Tian and Yang Guang, on loan from the People\\'s Republic of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh is also home to The Royal Yacht Britannia, decommissioned in 1997 and now a five-star visitor attraction and evening events venue permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh contains Scotland\\'s three National Galleries of Art as well as numerous smaller art galleries. The national collection is housed in the Scottish National Gallery, located on The Mound, comprising the linked National Gallery of Scotland building and the Royal Scottish Academy building. Contemporary collections are shown in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art which occupies a split site at Belford. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street focuses on portraits and photography.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|National Museum of Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\nThe council-owned City Art Centre in Market Street mounts regular art exhibitions. Across the road, The Fruitmarket Gallery offers world-class exhibitions of contemporary art, featuring work by British and international artists with both emerging and established international reputations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city hosts several of Scotland\\'s galleries and organisations dedicated to contemporary visual art. Significant strands of this infrastructure include Creative Scotland, Edinburgh College of Art, Talbot Rice Gallery (University of Edinburgh), Collective Gallery (based at the City Observatory) and the Edinburgh Annuale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also many small private shops/galleries that provide space to showcase works from local artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nShopping\\r\\nThe locale around Princes Street is the main shopping area in the city centre, with souvenir shops, chain stores such as Boots the Chemist, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, H&M and Jenners. George Street, north of Princes Street, is the preferred location for some upmarket shops and independent stores. At the east end of Princes Street, the redeveloped St James Quarter opened its doors in June 2021, while next to the Balmoral Hotel and Waverley Station is Waverley Market. Multrees Walk, adjacent to the St. James Centre, is a recent addition to the central shopping district, dominated by the presence of Harvey Nichols. Shops here include Louis Vuitton, Mulberry and Calvin Klein.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh also has substantial retail parks outside the city centre. These include The Gyle Shopping Centre and Hermiston Gait in the west of the city, Cameron Toll Shopping Centre, Straiton Retail Park (actually just outside the city, in Midlothian) and Fort Kinnaird in the south and east, and Ocean Terminal in the north on the Leith waterfront.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernance\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government\\r\\nthumb|right|Edinburgh City Chambers is the headquarters of the City of Edinburgh Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing local government reorganisation in 1996, the City of Edinburgh Council constitutes one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. Like all other local authorities of Scotland, the council has powers over most matters of local administration such as housing, planning, local transport, parks, economic development and regeneration. The council comprises 63 elected councillors, returned from 17 multi-member electoral wards in the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the 2007 City of Edinburgh Council election the incumbent Labour Party lost majority control of the council after 23 years to a Liberal Democrat/SNP coalition. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2017 election, the SNP and Labour formed a coalition administration, which lasted until the next election in 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2022 City of Edinburgh Council election resulted in the most politically balanced council in the UK, with 19 SNP, 13 Labour, 12 Liberal Democrat, 10 Green and 9 Conservative councillors. A minority Labour administration was formed, being voted in by Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat councillors. The SNP and Greens presented a coalition agreement, but could not command majority support in the Council. This caused controversy amongst the Scottish Labour Party group for forming an administration supported by Conservatives and led to the suspension of two Labour councillors on the Council for abstaining on the vote to approve the new administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city\\'s coat of arms was registered by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1732.\\r\\n\\r\\nScottish Parliament\\r\\nthumb|left|The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh, like all of Scotland, is represented in the Scottish Parliament, situated in the Holyrood area of the city. For electoral purposes, the city is divided into six constituencies which, along with 3 seats outside of the city, form part of the Lothian region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional MSPs to produce a result based on a form of proportional representation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2021 election, the Scottish National Party have four MSPs: Ash Denham for Edinburgh Eastern, Ben Macpherson for Edinburgh Northern and Leith and Gordon MacDonald for Edinburgh Pentlands and Angus Robertson for Edinburgh Central constituencies. Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats represents Edinburgh Western and Daniel Johnson of the Scottish Labour Party represents Edinburgh Southern constituency.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the city is also represented by seven regional MSPs representing the Lothian electoral region: The Conservatives have three regional MSPs: Jeremy Balfour, Miles Briggs and Sue Webber, Labour have two regional MSPs: Sarah Boyack and Foysol Choudhury; two Scottish Green  regional MSPs were elected: Green\\'s Co-Leader Lorna Slater and Alison Johnstone. However, following her election as the Presiding Officer of the 6th Session of the Scottish Parliament on 13 May 2021, Alison Johnstone has abided by the established parliamentary convention for speakers and renounced all affiliation with her former political party for the duration of her term as Presiding Officer. So she presently sits as an independent MSP for the Lothians Region.\\r\\n\\r\\nUK Parliament\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh is also represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by five Members of Parliament. The city is divided into Edinburgh North and Leith, Edinburgh East, Edinburgh South, Edinburgh South West, and Edinburgh West, each constituency electing one member by the first past the post system. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 2019 UK General election, Edinburgh is represented by three Scottish National Party MPs (Deirdre Brock, Edinburgh North and Leith/Tommy Sheppard, Edinburgh East/Joanna Cherry, Edinburgh South West), one Liberal Democrat MP in Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine) and one Labour MP in Edinburgh South (Ian Murray).\\r\\n\\r\\nTransport\\r\\n\\r\\nAir\\r\\nthumb|Edinburgh Airport\\r\\nEdinburgh Airport is Scotland\\'s busiest airport and the principal international gateway to the capital, handling over 14.7\\xa0million passengers; it was also the sixth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom by total passengers in 2019. In anticipation of rising passenger numbers, the former operator of the airport BAA outlined a draft masterplan in 2011 to provide for the expansion of the airfield and the terminal building. In June 2012, Global Infrastructure Partners purchased the airport for £807 million. The possibility of building a second runway to cope with an increased number of aircraft movements has also been mooted. \\r\\n\\r\\nBuses\\r\\nthumb|A Lothian Bus on North Bridge\\r\\nTravel in Edinburgh is undertaken predominantly by bus. Lothian Buses, the successor company to Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department, operate the majority of city bus services within the city and to surrounding suburbs, with the most routes running via Princes Street. Services further afield operate from the Edinburgh Bus Station off St Andrew Square and Waterloo Place and are operated mainly by Stagecoach East Scotland, Scottish Citylink, National Express Coaches and Borders Buses.\\r\\n\\r\\nLothian Buses and McGill\\'s Scotland East operate the city\\'s branded public tour buses. The night bus service and airport buses are mainly operated by Lothian Buses link. In 2019, Lothian Buses recorded 124.2 million passenger journeys.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo tackle traffic congestion, Edinburgh is now served by six park & ride sites on the periphery of the city at Sheriffhall (in Midlothian), Ingliston, Riccarton, Inverkeithing (in Fife), Newcraighall and Straiton (in Midlothian). A referendum of Edinburgh residents in February 2005 rejected a proposal to introduce congestion charging in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nRailway\\r\\nthumb|left|A train preparing to depart from Edinburgh Waverley station\\r\\nEdinburgh Waverley is the second-busiest railway station in Scotland, with only Glasgow Central handling more passengers. On the evidence of passenger entries and exits between April 2015 and March 2016, Edinburgh Waverley is the fifth-busiest station outside London; it is also the UK\\'s second biggest station in terms of the number of platforms and area size. Waverley is the terminus for most trains arriving from London King\\'s Cross and the departure point for many rail services within Scotland operated by ScotRail.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the west of the city centre lies Haymarket station, which is an important commuter stop. Opened in 2003, Edinburgh Park station serves the Gyle business park in the west of the city and the nearby Gogarburn headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Edinburgh Crossrail route connects Edinburgh Park with Haymarket, Edinburgh Waverley and the suburban stations of Brunstane and Newcraighall in the east of the city. There are also commuter lines to Edinburgh Gateway, South Gyle and Dalmeny, the latter serving South Queensferry by the Forth Bridges, and to Wester Hailes and Curriehill in the south-west of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrams\\r\\nthumb|Edinburgh Trams in Shandwick Place\\r\\nEdinburgh Trams became operational on 31 May 2014. The city had been without a tram system since Edinburgh Corporation Tramways ceased on 16 November 1956. Following parliamentary approval in 2007, construction began in early 2008. The first stage of the project was expected to be completed by July 2011 but, following delays caused by extra utility work and a long-running contractual dispute between the council and the main contractor, Bilfinger SE, the project was rescheduled. The completed line is  in length, running from Edinburgh Airport, west of the city, to its terminus at York Place in the city centre\\'s East End. Phase two of the tram project, which sees the existing section of Line 1 (Airport to York Place) tram line extended down Leith Walk to Ocean Terminal and terminate at Newhaven, adding an additional eight new tram stops and connecting Leith and the waterfront to the tram system. As of August 2022 this project is currently nearing completion, and is scheduled to open to passenger use in spring 2023. \\r\\n\\r\\nShould the original plan be taken to completion, trams will also run from Haymarket through Ravelston and Craigleith to Granton Square on the Waterfront Edinburgh. Long-term proposals envisage a line running west from the airport to Ratho and Newbridge and another connecting Granton Square to Newhaven via Lower Granton Road, thus completing the Line 1 (North Edinburgh) loop. A further line serving the south of the city has also been suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Edinburgh tramway map\\r\\n\\r\\nLothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams are both owned and operated by Transport for Edinburgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its modern transport links, in January of 2021 Edinburgh was named the most congested city in the UK for the fourth year running.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nthumb|New College of the University of Edinburgh\\r\\nThere are three universities in Edinburgh: the University of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt University and Edinburgh Napier University.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstablished by royal charter in 1583, the University of Edinburgh is one of Scotland\\'s ancient universities and is the fourth oldest in the country after St Andrews, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Originally centred on Old College the university expanded to premises on The Mound, the Royal Mile and George Square. Today, the King\\'s Buildings in the south of the city contain most of the schools within the College of Science and Engineering. In 2002, the medical school moved to purpose built accommodation adjacent to the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh at Little France. The university is placed 16th in the QS World University Rankings for 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeriot-Watt University is based at the Riccarton campus in the west of Edinburgh. Originally established in 1821, as the world\\'s first mechanics\\' institute, it was granted university status by royal charter in 1966. It has other campuses in the Scottish Borders, Orkney, United Arab Emirates and Putrajaya in Malaysia. It takes the name Heriot-Watt from Scottish inventor James Watt and Scottish philanthropist and goldsmith George Heriot. Heriot-Watt University has been named International University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018. In the latest Research Excellence Framework, it was ranked overall in the Top 25% of UK universities and 1st in Scotland for research impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh Napier University was originally founded as the Napier College, which was renamed Napier Polytechnic in 1986 and gained university status in 1992. Edinburgh Napier University has campuses in the south and west of the city, including the former Merchiston Tower and Craiglockhart Hydropathic. It is home to the Screen Academy Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Margaret University was located in Edinburgh before it moved to a new campus just outside the city boundary on the edge of Musselburgh in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2012, further education colleges in the city included Jewel and Esk College (incorporating Leith Nautical College founded in 1903), Telford College, opened in 1968, and Stevenson College, opened in 1970. These have now been amalgamated to form Edinburgh College. Scotland\\'s Rural College also has a campus in south Edinburgh. Other institutions include the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh which were established by royal charter in 1506 and 1681 respectively.

The city also has several independent, fee-paying schools including Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College, George Heriot\\'s School, George Watson\\'s College, Merchiston Castle School, Stewart\\'s Melville College and The Mary Erskine School. In 2009, the proportion of pupils attending independent schools was 24.2%, far above the Scottish national average of just over 7% and higher than in any other region of Scotland. In August 2013, the City of Edinburgh Council opened the city\\'s first stand-alone Gaelic primary school, Bun-sgoil Taobh na Pàirce.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealthcare\\r\\nthumb|right|The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh is the main public hospital for the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main NHS Lothian hospitals serving the Edinburgh area are the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which includes the University of Edinburgh Medical School, and the Western General Hospital, which has a large cancer treatment centre and nurse-led Minor Injuries Clinic. The Royal Edinburgh Hospital in Morningside specialises in mental health. The Royal Hospital for Children and Young People, colloquially referred to as the Sick Kids, is a specialist paediatrics hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two private hospitals: Murrayfield Hospital in the west of the city and Shawfair Hospital in the south; both are owned by Spire Healthcare.\\r\\n\\r\\nSport\\r\\nFootball\\r\\nMen\\'s\\r\\nEdinburgh has three football clubs that play in the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL): Heart of Midlothian, founded in 1874, Hibernian, founded in 1875 and F.C. Edinburgh, founded in 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeart of Midlothian and Hibernian are known locally as \"Hearts\" and \"Hibs\", respectively. Both play in the Scottish Premiership. They are the oldest city rivals in Scotland and the Edinburgh derby is one of the oldest derby matches in world football. Both clubs have won the Scottish league championship four times. Hearts have won the Scottish Cup eight times and the Scottish League Cup four times. Hibs have won the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup three times each. Edinburgh City were promoted to Scottish League Two in the 2015–16 season, becoming the first club to win promotion to the SPFL via the pyramid system playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdinburgh was also home to four other former Scottish Football League clubs: the original Edinburgh City (founded in 1928), Leith Athletic, Meadowbank Thistle and St Bernard\\'s. Meadowbank Thistle played at Meadowbank Stadium until 1995, when the club moved to Livingston and became Livingston F.C. The Scottish national team has very occasionally played at Easter Road and Tynecastle, although its normal home stadium is Hampden Park in Glasgow. St Bernard\\'s\\' New Logie Green was used to host the 1896 Scottish Cup Final, the only time the match has been played outside Glasgow.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p202 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe city also plays host to Lowland Football League clubs Civil Service Strollers, Edinburgh University and Spartans, as well as East of Scotland League clubs Craigroyston, Edinburgh United, Heriot-Watt University, Leith Athletic, Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale, and Tynecastle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen\\'s\\r\\nIn women\\'s football, Hearts, Hibs and Spartans play in the SWPL 1.

It includes educational institutions such as the , the  and the Institut de France, as well as Parisian monuments such as the Odéon-Théâtre de l\\'Europe, the Pont des Arts, which links the 1st and 6th arrondissements over the Seine, Saint-Germain Abbey and Saint-Sulpice Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis central arrondissement, which includes the historic districts of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (surrounding the abbey founded in the 6th century) and Luxembourg (surrounding the Palace and its Gardens), has played a major role throughout Parisian history and is well known for its café culture and the revolutionary intellectualism (existentialism, authors such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir) and literature (writers Paul Éluard, Boris Vian, Albert Camus and Françoise Sagan) it has hosted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its cityscape, intellectual tradition, history, architecture and central location, the arrondissement has long been home to French intelligentsia. It is a major locale for art galleries and fashion stores, as well as Paris\\'s most expensive area. The arrondissement is one of France\\'s richest districts in terms of average income; it is part of Paris Ouest alongside the 7th, 8th and 16th arrondissements, as well as the Neuilly-sur-Seine inner suburb. The 6th arrondissement is the smallest in Paris in terms of area covered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThe current 6th arrondissement, dominated by the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés—founded in the 6th century—was the heart of the Catholic Church\\'s power in Paris for centuries, hosting many religious institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|The Luxembourg Palace on the Rue de Vaugirard houses the Senate.\\r\\nIn 1612, Queen Marie de Médicis bought an estate in the district and commissioned architect Salomon de Brosse to transform it into the outstanding Luxembourg Palace surrounded by extensive royal gardens.

It was established in 2010 and formally created as a university in 2019. It is a collegiate university with 11 constituent schools, with the oldest founded in 1530. PSL is located in central Paris, with its main sites in the Latin Quarter, at the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève campus, at the Jourdan campus, at Porte Dauphine, and at Carré Richelieu.\\r\\n\\r\\nPSL awards Bachelor\\'s, Master\\'s, and PhD diplomas for its constituent schools and institutes. It offers an education based on research and interdisciplinary instruction, and its  students have access to a broad range of disciplines in science, engineering, humanities, social sciences, fine art and performing arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPSL alumni and staff include 28 Nobel laureates, 11 Fields Medalists, 3 Abel laureates, 49 CNRS Gold Medalists, 50 César winners and 79 Molière winners.\\r\\n\\r\\n History \\r\\nthumb|left|Collège de France, one leading college of PSL University\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, institutions in the Latin Quarter began thinking of how to join forces to boost their international visibility. The French law on research promulgated in 2006, which encouraged the formation of research networks (in various forms including PRES and RTRA), paved the way for new projects such as Paris Universitas, PRES ParisTech and an early version of the PSL project. This new organization combined five institutions of higher education in the Latin Quarter: Chimie ParisTech, , , École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI Paris), and Observatoire de Paris.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2010/04/16/cinq-grandes-ecoles-parisiennes-creent-une-fondation_1335060_3224.html |title=Cinq grandes écoles parisiennes créent une fondation |newspaper=Le Monde |date=16 April 2010}}</ref> Together, they adopted the status of a scientific cooperation foundation (FCS) (fr). The new entity, called \"Paris Sciences et Lettres – Quartier Latin\", was initially conceived as a scientific alliance.. In 2011, the five institutions submitted a joint application for the Initiatives for Excellence (IDEX) as part of France\\'s Investing for the Future program (PIA), causing the project to evolve into a new form of French university. This university would have 70% of its students at the Master\\'s and PhD level and offer a Bachelor\\'s program, with an emphasis on equal opportunity students (40% scholarship students in the CPES multidisciplinary preparatory class).\\r\\nthumb|left|Dauphine, college of PSL University\\r\\n\\r\\n Development \\r\\nBetween 2011 and 2012, ten new institutions joined the foundation: Conservatoire National Supérieur d\\'Art Dramatique, Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris, École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, La Fémis, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Foundation for Research, Institut Curie, Institut Louis-Bachelier, MINES ParisTech and Université Paris-Dauphine.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir arrival reinforced PSL\\'s scientific potential in the fields of engineering, biology, the arts, and management. In 2014, another four institutions specializing in humanities and social science joined the association: École Française d\\'Extrême-Orient, École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), École Nationale des Chartes, and École Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE).In 2015, PSL organized itself into a university community (ComUE: PSL Research University).. PSL began awarding PhDs at that point.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Investing for the Future\" program \\r\\nIn 2010, the French government launched a call for proposals to boost higher education: the Investing for the Future program (also called the grand emprunt). PSL has successfully responded to several calls for proposals. In 2011, with the Initiatives for Excellence call for proposals, PSL was one of the first three projects selected, along with Université de Bordeaux and Université de Strasbourg.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the diversity of project participants has sometimes been cited as a weakness, the promoters of PSL underline the complementarity of its institutions and the potential for collaboration. The funding of the Excellence Initiative has, in addition, supported the creation of 11 Laboratories of excellence (Labex) within PSL: CelTisPhyBio, DCBIOL, DEEP, DYNAMO, ENS-ICFP, ESEP, IEC, IPGG, MemoLife, TransferS, and WIFI. In 2014, the Corail, HaStec, and TEPSIS Labex laboratories joined the list with EHESS and EPHE becoming members of PSL. \\r\\nAlso in 2011, PSL\\'s institutions presented ten projects under the \"Equipped with excellence\" (Equipex) program. Among the initial submissions, they obtained eight Equipex facilities: BEDOFIH, D-FIH, Equip@Meso, ICGex, IPGG, Paris-en-Resonnance, Planaqua, Ultrabrain. These projects have received funding ranging from 2 to 10 million euros.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, after a detailed review process, nine institutions agreed to put in place an integrated budget and a multi-year strategy for academic recruitment, as well as to create a number of shared platforms and services. Chimie ParisTech, École Nationale des Chartes, École Normale Supérieure, École Pratique des Hautes Etudes, ESPCI Paris, Institut Curie, Observatoire de Paris, MINES ParisTech, Université Paris-Dauphine decided to jointly form Université PSL. \\r\\nThe agreement approved by their respective boards calls for the schools and institutions that form the university to adopt a unified strategy, to submit to the budgetary authority of the president of the university, to jointly plan their recruitment, and to transfer the whole of their diplomas to PSL. Towards the end of the process, in 2018, one of the former members, EHESS, did not approve the new statutes and decided not to be part of the target University.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaux-Arts de Paris, Collège de France, Conservatoire National Supérieur d\\'Art Dramatique, Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris, École Française d\\'Extrême-Orient, École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, La Fémis, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique and Institut Louis Bachelier are recognized as associates of the university pending later integration.\\r\\n\\r\\n University status (2019) \\r\\nIn December 2018, an opportunity to formally create a full University arose with a new Ordonnance (ordinance) allowing to create a collegiate university, whose constituents may keep their legal personality, similar to British collegiate universities like Oxford and Cambridge. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2019, a decree creating Université PSL as a collegiate university, together with the new statutes of the University, is published. A few changes had occurred in the list of constituents, with nine institutions approving the new statutes and becoming  (constituent colleges): Chimie ParisTech, Conservatoire national supérieur d\\'art dramatique, École Nationale des Chartes, École normale supérieure, , ESPCI Paris, Observatoire de Paris, MINES ParisTech, Paris Dauphine. Additionally, College de France and Institut Curie became associate members, participating closely in the governance of the University. Associate members contribute to the strategy of the University, receive financial resources from PSL University and may carry scientific programs on behalf and by delegation thereof.\\r\\n\\r\\n Organisation and administration \\r\\nPSL is a collegiate university ( students). It consists of 11 constituent schools, with plans to gradually expand to include some or all other associate colleges. Three national research organisations (CNRS, Inserm, Inria) are involved in governance and help to define PSL\\'s strategy, with which they coordinate their own strategies.\\r\\n\\r\\n Constituent colleges \\r\\nNameFoundationFoundation of the oldest constituent part of the schoolTypeFieldStudentsCampusÉcole nationale supérieure de chimie1896Grande écoleEngineering300ParisConservatoire national supérieur d\\'art dramatique1784Grande écoleDrama100ParisÉcole normale supérieure1794Grande écoleScience and Human science2,400ParisÉcole Pratique des Hautes Études1868Grand établissementEarth and Life Sciences, Historical and Philological Sciences, and Religious Sciences2,000ParisÉcole supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles1882Grande écoleEngineering360ParisÉcole nationale des chartes1821Grande écoleHistorical science170ParisÉcole nationale supérieure des mines1783Grande écoleEngineering1500ParisObservatoire de Paris1667Grand établissementScience, Astrophysics150Paris, Meudon, NançayParis-Dauphine Universityc. 1150 (University of Paris), 1968Grande école, Grand établissementMathematics, Computer Science, Management, Economics, Finance, Law, Political Science, Journalism10,000Paris1530Grand établissementSciences, Arts and LettersLatin QuarterCurie Institute1920Governmental organisationScience, Medicine\\r\\n\\r\\n Associate colleges \\r\\nNameFoundationTypeFieldStudentsCampusÉcole nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts1817Grande écoleArts530ParisÉcole française d\\'Extrême-Orient (EFEO)1900Research instituteCultureParisÉcole nationale d\\'administration (ENA)1945Grande écolePublic Administration533StrasbourgÉcole nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs1766Grande écoleArt and design700ParisÉcole nationale supérieure des métiers de l\\'Image et du Son (La Fémis)1943Grande écoleFilm and television230ParisLycée Henri-IV1796Secondary school1,948ParisInstitut Louis Bachelier2008OrganizationEconomics and scienceParisENSA Paris-Malaquais1968Grande écoleArchitectureParis\\r\\n\\r\\n Presidents \\r\\nThe current president is Alain Fuchs.

University of Manchester is a public research university in Manchester, England. The main campus is south of Manchester City Centre on Oxford Road. The university owns and operates major cultural assets such as the Manchester Museum, The Whitworth art gallery, the John Rylands Library, the Tabley House Collection and the Jodrell Bank Observatory – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The University of Manchester is considered a red brick university, a product of the civic university movement of the late 19th century. The current University of Manchester was formed in 2004 following the merger of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) and the Victoria University of Manchester.Encyclopædia Britannica (15th edn) vol.7 p. 760 and vol.23, p. 462. This followed a century of the two institutions working closely with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology had its origins in the Mechanics\\' Institute, which was founded in 1824. The present University of Manchester considers this date, which is also the date of foundation of the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, one of the predecessor institutions of the Victoria University of Manchester, as its official foundation year, as indicated in its crest and logo. The founders of the institute believed that all professions somewhat relied on scientific principles. As such, the institute taught working individuals branches of science applicable to their existing occupations. They believed that the practical application of science would encourage innovation and advancements within those trades and professions. The Victoria University of Manchester was founded in 1851, as Owens College. Academic research undertaken by the university was published via the Manchester University Press from 1904.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester is the third-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and receives over 92,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the most popular university in the UK by volume of applications. The University of Manchester is a member of the Russell Group, the N8 Group, and the US-based Universities Research Association. The University of Manchester, inclusive of its predecessor institutions, has had 25 Nobel laureates amongst its past and present students and staff, the fourth-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom. \\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nOrigins (1824 to 2004)\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|The Old Quadrangle at the University of Manchester\\'s main campus on Oxford Road\\r\\nThe University of Manchester traces its roots to the formation of the Mechanics\\' Institute (later UMIST) in 1824, and its heritage is linked to Manchester\\'s pride in being the world\\'s first industrial city. The English chemist John Dalton, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics\\' Institute to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Owens, a textile merchant, left a bequest of £96,942 in 1846 (around £5.6 million in 2005 prices) to found a college to educate men on non-sectarian lines. His trustees established Owens College in 1851 in a house on the corner of Quay Street and Byrom Street which had been the home of the philanthropist Richard Cobden, and subsequently housed Manchester County Court. The locomotive designer Charles Beyer became a governor of the college and was the largest single donor to the college extension fund, which raised the money to move to a new site and construct the main building now known as the John Owens building. He also campaigned and helped fund the engineering chair, the first applied science department in the north of England. He left the college the equivalent of £10 million in his will in 1876, at a time when it was in great financial difficulty. Beyer funded the total cost of construction of the Beyer Building to house the biology and geology departments. His will also funded Engineering chairs and the Beyer Professor of Applied mathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university has a rich German heritage. The Owens College Extension Movement formed their plans after a tour of mainly German universities and polytechnics. A Manchester mill owner, Thomas Ashton, chairman of the extension movement, had studied at Heidelberg University. Sir Henry Roscoe also studied at Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen and they collaborated for many years on research projects. Roscoe promoted the German style of research-led teaching that became the role model for the red-brick universities. Charles Beyer studied at Dresden Academy Polytechnic. There were many Germans on the staff, including Carl Schorlemmer, Britain\\'s first chair in organic chemistry, and Arthur Schuster, professor of physics. There was even a German chapel on the campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1873, Owens College moved to new premises on Oxford Road, Chorlton-on-Medlock, and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the federal Victoria University. This university was established and granted a royal charter in 1880, becoming England\\'s first civic university; following Liverpool and Leeds becoming independent, it was renamed the Victoria University of Manchester in 1903 and absorbed Owens College the following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1905, the two institutions were large and active forces. The Municipal College of Technology, forerunner of UMIST, was the Victoria University of Manchester\\'s Faculty of Technology while continuing in parallel as a technical college offering advanced courses of study. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the universities continued to work together.  However, in the late-20th century, formal connections between the university and UMIST diminished and in 1994 most of the remaining institutional ties were severed as new legislation allowed UMIST to become an autonomous university with powers to award its own degrees. A decade later the development was reversed. The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst their former staff and students, with two further Nobel laureates being subsequently added. Manchester has traditionally been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by Ernest Rutherford, and the world\\'s first electronic stored-program computer was built at the university. Notable scientists associated with the university include physicists Ernest Rutherford, Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart. Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by Paul Erdős, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing and in philosophy by Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre. The author Anthony Burgess, Pritzker Prize and RIBA Stirling Prize-winning architect Norman Foster and composer Peter Maxwell Davies all attended, or worked at, Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-merger (2004 to present)\\r\\nthumb|The Sackville Street Building, formerly the UMIST Main Building\\r\\nThe current University of Manchester was officially launched on 1 October 2004 when Queen Elizabeth II bestowed its royal charter. The university was named the Sunday Times University of the Year in 2006 after winning the inaugural Times Higher Education Supplement University of the Year prize in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founding president and vice-chancellor of the new university was Alan Gilbert, former vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who retired at the end of the 2009–2010 academic year. His successor was Dame Nancy Rothwell, who had held a chair in physiology at the university since 1994. One of the university\\'s aims stated in the Manchester 2015 Agenda is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world, following on from Alan Gilbert\\'s aim to \"establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance\". In 2011, four Nobel laureates were on its staff: Andre Geim, Konstantin Novoselov, Sir John Sulston and Joseph E. Stiglitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EPSRC announced in February 2012 the formation of the National Graphene Institute. The University of Manchester is the \"single supplier invited to submit a proposal for funding the new £45m institute, £38m of which will be provided by the government\" – (EPSRC & Technology Strategy Board). In 2013, an additional £23 million of funding from European Regional Development Fund was awarded to the institute taking investment to £61 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2012, it was announced that the university\\'s Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences had been chosen to be the \"hub\" location for a new BP International Centre for Advanced Materials, as part of a $100 million initiative to create industry-changing materials. The centre will be aimed at advancing fundamental understanding and use of materials across a variety of oil and gas industrial applications and will be modelled on a hub and spoke structure, with the hub located at Manchester, and the spokes based at the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2020 the university saw a series of student rent strikes and protests in opposition to the university\\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, rent levels and living conditions in the university\\'s halls of residence. The protests ended with a negotiated rent reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, a second rent strike and student protest in opposition to the university\\'s rent price and living conditions in the halls of residence started. The protests included occupations, marches and student\\'s withholding their rent in University accommodation. The University\\'s response to the protests included using bailiffs to evict occupiers and taking disciplinary action against some occupiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCampus\\r\\nthumb|A map of the university campus, with all buildings labelled\\r\\nThe university\\'s main site contains most of its facilities and is often referred to as the campus, however Manchester is not a campus university as the concept is commonly understood. It is centrally located in the city and its buildings are integrated into the fabric of Manchester, with non-university buildings and major roads between.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campus occupies an area shaped roughly like a boot: the foot of which is aligned roughly south-west to north-east and is joined to the broader southern part of the boot by an area of overlap between former UMIST and former VUM buildings; it comprises two parts:\\r\\nNorth campus or Sackville Street Campus, centred on Sackville Street in Manchester\\r\\nSouth campus or Oxford Road Campus, centred on Oxford Road.\\r\\nThe names are not officially recognised by the university, but are commonly used, including in parts of its website and roughly correspond to the campuses of the old UMIST and Victoria University respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nFallowfield Campus is the main residential campus in Fallowfield, approximately  south of the main site.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other university buildings across the city and the wider region, such as Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire and One Central Park in Moston, a collaboration between the university and other partners which offers office space for start-up firms and venues for conferences and workshops,\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor projects\\r\\nthumb|The atrium inside the £38m Manchester Institute of Biotechnology\\r\\nFollowing the merger, the university embarked on a £600 million programme of capital investment, to deliver eight new buildings and 15 major refurbishment projects by 2010, partly financed by a sale of unused assets.Manchester Evening News 31 July 2007  These include:\\r\\n £60 m Flagship University Place building (new build)\\r\\n £56 m Alan Turing Building houses Mathematics, replaced Mathematics Tower.

The first to be built was the John Owens Building (1873), formerly the Main Building; the others were added over the next thirty years. Today, the museum continues to occupy part of one side, including the tower. The grand setting of the Whitworth Hall is used for the conferment of degrees, and part of the old Christie Library (1898) now houses Christie\\'s Bistro. The remainder of the buildings house administrative departments. The less easily accessed Rear Quadrangle, dating mostly from 1873, is older in its completed form than the Old Quadrangle.\\r\\n\\r\\nContact\\r\\nthumb|left|The Contact Theatre\\r\\n\\r\\nContact stages modern live performance for all ages, and participatory workshops primarily for young people aged 13 to 30.

The colourful and curvaceous interior houses three performance spaces, a lounge bar and Hot Air, a reactive public artwork in the foyer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable buildings\\r\\nOther notable buildings in the Oxford Road Campus include the Stephen Joseph Studio, a former German Protestant church and the Samuel Alexander Building, a grade II listed building erected in 1919 and home of the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Sackville Street Campus is the Sackville Street Building which was formerly UMIST\\'s \"Main Building\". It was opened in 1902 by the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour. Built using Burmantofts terracotta, the building is now Grade II listed. It was extended along Whitworth Street, towards London Road, between 1927 and 1957 by the architects Bradshaw Gass & Hope, completion being delayed due to the depression in the 1930s and the Second World War.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganisation and administration\\r\\nFaculties and schools\\r\\nThe University of Manchester was divided into four faculties, but from 1 August 2016 it was restructured into three faculties, each sub-divided into schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 June 2015, the University of Manchester announced the results of a review of the position of life sciences as a separate faculty. As a result of this review the Faculty of Life Sciences was to be dismantled, most of its personnel to be incorporated into a single medical/biological faculty, with a substantial minority being incorporated into a science and engineering faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaculty of Biology, Medicine and Health\\r\\nthumb|Old Medical School on Coupland Street (photographed in 1908), which now houses the School of Dentistry\\r\\nThe faculty is divided into the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Medical Sciences and the School of Health Sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological Sciences have been taught at Manchester as far back as the foundation of Owens College in 1851. At UMIST, biological teaching and research began in 1959, with the creation of a Biochemistry department.Wilson, D (2008) Reconfiguring Biological Sciences in the Late Twentieth Century: a Study of the University of Manchester. Manchester University, pp. 7–16 The present school, though unitary for teaching, is divided into a number of sections for research purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical college was established in 1874 and is one of the largest in the country, with more than 400 medical students trained in each clinical year and more than 350 students in the pre-clinical/phase 1 years. The university is a founding partner of the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, established to focus high-end healthcare research in Greater Manchester. In November 2018, Expertscape recognized it as one of the top ten institutions worldwide in COPD research and treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1883, a department of pharmacy was established at the university and, in 1904, Manchester became the first British university to offer an honours degree in the subject. The School of Pharmacy benefits from links with Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe and Hope hospitals providing its undergraduate students with hospital experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester Dental School was rated the country\\'s best dental school by Times Higher Education in 2010 and 2011 and it is one of the best funded because of its emphasis on research and enquiry-based learning approach. The university has obtained multimillion-pound backing to maintain its high standard of dental education.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaculty of Science and Engineering\\r\\nthumb|right|The Grade I listed Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory\\r\\nThe Faculty of Science and Engineering is divided into two schools.

The University of Manchester attracts international students from 160 countries around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell-known members of the university\\'s current academic staff include computer scientist Steve Furber, economist Richard Nelson, novelist Jeanette Winterson and biochemist Sir John Sulston, Nobel Prize laureate of 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch\\r\\nThe University of Manchester is a major centre for research and a member of the Russell Group of leading British research universities.  In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and eighth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (tenth when including specialist institutions). In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and fifteenth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (seventeenth when including specialist institutions). Manchester has the sixth largest research income of any English university (after Oxford, University College London (UCL), Cambridge, Imperial and King\\'s College London), and has been informally referred to as part of a \"golden diamond\" of research-intensive UK institutions (adding Manchester to the Oxford–Cambridge–London \"Golden Triangle\"). Manchester has a strong record in terms of securing funding from the three main UK research councils, EPSRC, MRC and BBSRC, being ranked fifth, seventh and first respectively. In addition, the university is one of the richest in the UK in terms of income and interest from endowments: an estimate in 2008 placed it third, surpassed only by Oxford and Cambridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Manchester has attracted the most research income from UK industry of any institution in the country. The figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), show that Manchester attracted £24,831,000 of research income in 2016–2017 from UK industry, commerce and public corporations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, Manchester has been linked with high scientific achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had 25 Nobel laureates among their students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Oxford and Cambridge) and the ninth largest of any university in Europe. Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the university (namely the first working computer and the contraceptive pill). The university currently employs four Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, more than any other in the UK. The Langworthy Professorship, an endowed chair at the university\\'s Department of Physics and Astronomy, has been historically given to a long line of academic luminaries, including Ernest Rutherford (1907–19), Lawrence Bragg (1919–37), Patrick Blackett (1937–53) and more recently Konstantin Novoselov, all of whom have won the Nobel Prize. In 2013 Manchester was given the Regius Professorship in Physics, the only one of its kind in the UK; the current holder is Andre Geim.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibraries\\r\\nthumb|right|The Grade-I listed John Rylands Library on Deansgate\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Manchester Library is the largest non-legal deposit library in the UK and the third-largest academic library after those of Oxford and Cambridge.SCONUL Annual Library Statistics; 2005–2006 It has the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe John Rylands Library, founded in memory of John Rylands by his wife Enriqueta Augustina Rylands as an independent institution, is situated in a Victorian Gothic building on Deansgate, in the city centre. It houses an important collection of historic books and other printed materials, manuscripts, including archives and papyri. The papyri are in ancient languages and include the oldest extant New Testament document, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, commonly known as the St John Fragment. In April 2007 the Deansgate site reopened to readers and the public after major improvements and renovations, including the construction of the pitched roof originally intended and a new wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections\\r\\nManchester Museum\\r\\nthumb|upright|The entrance to the Manchester Museum\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manchester Museum holds nearly 4.25 million items sourced from many parts of the world. The collections include butterflies and carvings from India, birds and bark-cloth from the Pacific, live frogs and ancient pottery from America, fossils and native art from Australia, mammals and ancient Egyptian craftsmanship from Africa, plants, coins and minerals from Europe, art from past civilisations of the Mediterranean, and beetles, armour and archery from Asia. In November 2004, the museum acquired a cast of a fossilised Tyrannosaurus rex called \"Stan\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum\\'s first collections were assembled in 1821 by the Manchester Society of Natural History, and subsequently expanded by the addition of the collections of Manchester Geological Society. Due to the society\\'s financial difficulties and on the advice of evolutionary biologist Thomas Huxley, Owens College accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, architect of London\\'s Natural History Museum, to design a museum on a site in Oxford Road to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public. The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888.The History of The Manchester Museum, University of Manchester .

In 1901 the women\\'s athletic union was founded. In 1981 the two unions were amalgamated. After the acquisition of the Firs estate in Fallowfield a sports ground and pavilion were provided there. From 1940 the McDougall Centre in Burlington Street was also in use as a sports centre. Ron Hill, Rowena Sweatman, James Hickman, Cyril Holmes and Harry Whittle are former students who have achieved Olympic success.The Legacy of John Owens: 150 years of university teaching in Manchester.

The main facilities used for sports are the Sugden Centre in Grosvenor Street, the Armitage Site near Owens Park and the Wythenshawe Sports Ground.The University of Manchester prospectus 2005. Manchester: University, 2005; p. 266\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university has achieved success in the BUCS (British University & College Sports) competitions, with its men\\'s water polo 1st team winning the national championships (2009, 2010, 2011) under the tutelage of their coach Andy Howard. It was positioned in eighth place in the overall BUCS rankings for 2009/10\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university competes annually in 28 different sports against Leeds and Liverpool universities in the Christie Cup, which Manchester has won for seven consecutive years. The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886. After the Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, the Christie\\'s Championships is the oldest Inter–University competition on the sporting calendar: the cup was a benefaction of Richard Copley Christie.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery year elite sportsmen and sportswomen are selected for membership of the XXI Club, a society formed in 1932 to promote sporting excellence at the university. Most members have gained a Full Maroon for representing the university and many have excelled at a British Universities or National level. No more than 21 active members are allowed, each elected for up to three years (after graduating they become passive members).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of the university clubs is the lacrosse club which was founded in the season 1883–84 and in the following years won the North of England Flags twice and maintained its position among the leading English clubs. In 1885 it was one of the four founding clubs of the athletic union. The merging of Owens College with the university in 1904 affected the club by restricting the pool of players available for selection. However, when the English Universities Lacrosse Championship was set up in 1925–26 with five university teams the Manchester team won in the first season and again in 1932–33 and continued to do so in the 1930s.Melland, Charles H. (1939) \"The University Lacrosse Club\", in: The Journal of the University of Manchester, vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 74–76\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversity Challenge quiz programme\\r\\nIn the eight years up to 2013, Manchester has won the BBC2 quiz programme University Challenge four times, drawing equal with Magdalen College, Oxford, for the highest number of series wins. Since merging as the University of Manchester, the university has consistently reached the latter stages of the competition, progressing to at least the semi-finals every year since 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Manchester beat Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to record the university\\'s first win in the competition. The next year, the university finished in second place after losing to the University of Warwick in the final. In 2009, the team battled hard in the final against Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At the gong, the score was 275 to 190 in favour of Corpus Christi College after a winning performance from Gail Trimble. However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated eight months before the final was broadcast, so the team was disqualified.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester reached the semi-finals in the 2010 competition before being beaten by Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The university did not enter the 2011 series for an unknown reason. However, Manchester did enter a year later and won University Challenge 2012. Manchester has since defended its title to win University Challenge 2013, beating University College London, 190 to 140.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent housing\\r\\nthumb|Ashburne Hall, a catered accommodation offered mainly to undergraduate students, though some places are reserved for postgraduate students\\r\\nBefore they merged, the two former universities had for some time been sharing their residential facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nCity Campus\\r\\n\\r\\nWhitworth Park Halls of Residence is owned by the University of Manchester and houses 1,085 students, located next to Whitworth Park. It is notable for its triangular shaped accommodation blocks. Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from excavated soil which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater. A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company. A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area. They were built in the mid-1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Dilworth House, one of the Whitworth Park halls of residence\\r\\nThe site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names of the halls. Grove House is an older building that has been used by the university for many different purposes over the last sixty years. Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the Manchester University Press.Charlton, H. B.(1951) Portrait of a University. Manchester: U.

It is bordered by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east, and the neighbouring city of Salford to the west. The two cities and the surrounding towns form one of the United Kingdom\\'s most populous conurbations, the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, which had a population of 2.87 million in 2021. The city borders the boroughs of Trafford, Stockport, Tameside, Oldham, Rochdale, Bury and Salford. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort (castra) of Mamucium or Mancunium, established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. Throughout the Middle Ages, Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand \"at an astonishing rate\" around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester\\'s unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and resulted in it becoming the world\\'s first industrialised city.• •  Historically part of Lancashire, areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated into Manchester in the 20th century, including Wythenshawe in 1931.  Manchester achieved city status in 1853. The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894, creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to the Irish Sea,  to the west. Its fortune declined after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation, and the IRA bombing in 1996 led to extensive investment and regeneration. Following considerable redevelopment, Manchester was the host city for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is notable for its architecture, culture, musical exports, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact, sports clubs and transport connections. Manchester Liverpool Road railway station is the world\\'s oldest surviving inter-city passenger railway station. At the University of Manchester, Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917; Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill developed the world\\'s first stored-program computer in 1948; and Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov first isolated graphene in 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester has a large urban sprawl, which forms from the city centre into the other neighbouring authorities; these include The Four Heatons, Failsworth, Prestwich, Stretford, Sale, Droylsden, Old Trafford and Reddish. The city is also contiguous with Salford and its borough, but is separated from it by the River Irwell. This urban area is cut off by the M60, also known as the Manchester Outer Ring Road, which runs in a circular around the city and these areas. It joins the M62 to the north-east and the M602 to the west, as well as the East Lancashire Road and A6.\\r\\n\\r\\nToponymy\\r\\nThe name Manchester originates from the Latin name  or its variant  and the citizens are still referred to as Mancunians (). These names are generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brittonic name. The generally accepted etymology of this name is that it comes from Brittonic *- (\"breast\", in reference to a \"breast-like hill\").The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society, ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), under MANCHESTER. However, more recent work suggests that it could come from * (\"mother\", in reference to a local river goddess). Both usages are preserved in Insular Celtic languages, such as  meaning \"breast\" in Irish and \"mother\" in Welsh. The suffix -chester is from Old English  (\"Roman fortification\", itself a loanword from Latin , \"fort; fortified town\").\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly history\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brigantes were the major Celtic tribe in what is now known as Northern England; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands, opposite the bank of the River Irwell. Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now Salford and Stretford. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century, General Agricola ordered the construction of a fort named Mamucium in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) were protected from the Brigantes. Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time. A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in Castlefield. The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; its civilian settlement appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century. After the Roman withdrawal and Saxon conquest, the focus of settlement shifted to the confluence of the Irwell and Irk sometime before the arrival of the Normans after 1066. Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent Harrying of the North.\\r\\nthumb|left|Cotton mills in Ancoats, \\r\\nthumb|left|The Peterloo Massacre of 1819 resulted in 15 deaths and several hundred injured.\\r\\nIn the Domesday Book of 1086, Manchester is recorded as within the hundred of Salford and held as tenant in chief by a Norman named Roger of Poitou, later being held by the family of Grelley, lord of the manor and residents of Manchester Castle until 1215 before a Manor House was built. By 1421 Thomas de la Warre founded and constructed a collegiate church for the parish, now Manchester Cathedral; the domestic premises of the college house Chetham\\'s School of Music and Chetham\\'s Library. The library, which opened in 1653 and is still open to the public today, is the oldest free public reference library in the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester is mentioned as having a market in 1282. Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of Flemish weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the region\\'s textile industry. Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen, and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in John Leland\\'s words, \"The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire\". The cathedral and Chetham\\'s buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland\\'s Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the English Civil War Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting, Cromwell granted it the right to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals. He was a diligent puritan, turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain\\'s first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton. Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A commodities exchange, opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester\\'s first cotton mill. In the early 1800s, John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial Revolution\\r\\nManchester was one of the centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester became known as the world\\'s largest marketplace for cotton goods and was dubbed \"Cottonopolis\" and \"Warehouse City\" during the Victorian era. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term \"manchester\" is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc. The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester\\'s population.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester began expanding \"at an astonishing rate\" around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the Industrial Revolution. It developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 \"Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world\". Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world\\'s first intercity passenger railway—the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down. In 1878 the GPO (the forerunner of British Telecom) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manchester Ship Canal was built between 1888 and 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running  from Salford to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal\\'s banks, just outside the borough, the world\\'s first industrial estate was created at Trafford Park. Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nA centre of capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city\\'s working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the Peterloo massacre of 16 August 1819. The economic school of Manchester Capitalism developed there, and Manchester was the centre of the Anti-Corn Law League from 1838 onward.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels\\' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham\\'s Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics\\' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\"•• Manchester\\'s golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city\\'s cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=0.9|An oil painting of Oxford Road, Manchester, in 1910, by Valette\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\". An American visitor taken to Manchester\\'s blackspots saw \"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of cotton mills in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853. Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s. However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of the city as the financial centre of the region. Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world\\'s cotton was processed in the area. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlitz\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most of the UK, the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the Second World War. For example, casting and machining expertise at Beyer, Peacock & Company\\'s locomotive works in Gorton was switched to bomb making; Dunlop\\'s rubber works in Chorlton-on-Medlock made barrage balloons; and just outside the city in Trafford Park, engineers Metropolitan-Vickers made Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster bombers and Ford built the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the Luftwaffe, and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the Christmas Blitz on the nights of 22/23 and 24 December 1940, when an estimated  of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged. Manchester Cathedral, Royal Exchange and Free Trade Hall were among the buildings seriously damaged; restoration of the cathedral took 20 years. In total, 589 civilians were recorded to have died as result of enemy action within the Manchester County Borough.\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-Second World War\\r\\nCotton processing and trading continued to fall in peacetime, and the exchange closed in 1968. By 1963 the port of Manchester was the UK\\'s third largest,•  and employed over 3,000 men, but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large container ships. Traffic declined, and the port closed in 1982. Heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by Margaret Thatcher\\'s government after 1979. Manchester lost 150,000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|Corporation Street after the Manchester bombing on 15 June 1996. There were no fatalities, but it was one of the most expensive man-made disasters. A large rebuilding project of Manchester ensued.\\r\\nRegeneration began in the late 1980s, with initiatives such as the Metrolink, the Bridgewater Concert Hall, the Manchester Arena, and (in Salford) the rebranding of the port as Salford Quays. Two bids to host the Olympic Games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city.\\r\\nthumb|Oxford Road, one of the main thoroughfares into Manchester city centre\\r\\nManchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the Manchester Martyrs of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992.\\r\\nOn Saturday 15 June 1996, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out the 1996 Manchester bombing, the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows  away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50\\xa0million, but this was quickly revised upwards. The final insurance payout was over £400\\xa0million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2000\\r\\nSpurred by the investment after the 1996 bombing and aided by the XVII Commonwealth Games, the city centre has undergone extensive regeneration.   New and renovated complexes such as The Printworks and Corn Exchange have become popular shopping, eating and entertainment areas. Manchester Arndale is the UK\\'s largest city-centre shopping centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge city sections from the 1960s have been demolished, re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel. Old mills have been converted into apartments. Hulme has undergone extensive regeneration, with million-pound loft-house apartments being developed. The 47-storey,  Beetham Tower was the tallest UK building outside of London and the highest residential accommodation in Europe when completed in 2006. It was surpassed in 2018 by the  South Tower of the Deansgate Square project, also in Manchester. In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel licensed Manchester to build the UK\\'s only supercasino, but plans were abandoned in February 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 May 2017, an Islamist terrorist carried out a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in the Manchester Arena; the bomb killed 23, including the attacker, and injured over 800. It was the deadliest terrorist attack and first suicide bombing in Britain since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. It caused worldwide condemnation and changed the UK\\'s threat level to  \"critical\" for the first time since 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nBirmingham has historically been considered to be England or the UK\\'s second city, but in the 21st century claims to this unofficial title have also been made for Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|Manchester Town Hall in Albert Square, seat of local government, is an example of Victorian era Gothic revival architecture.\\r\\nThe City of Manchester is governed by the Manchester City Council. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority, with a directly elected mayor, has responsibilities for economic strategy and transport, amongst other areas, on a Greater Manchester-wide basis. Manchester has been a member of the English Core Cities Group since its inception in 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301, but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century local government was largely in the hands of manorial courts, the last of which was dissolved in 1846.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a very early time, the township of Manchester lay within the historic or ceremonial county boundaries of Lancashire. Pevsner wrote \"That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England\". A stroke of a baron\\'s pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford, though it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester, it was Manchester, with its humbler line of lords, that was separated from Salford. It was this separation that resulted in Salford becoming the judicial seat of Salfordshire, which included the ancient parish of Manchester. Manchester later formed its own Poor Law Union using the name \"Manchester\". In 1792, Commissioners – usually known as \"Police Commissioners\" – were established for the social improvement of Manchester. Manchester regained its borough status in 1838, and comprised the townships of Beswick, Cheetham Hill, Chorlton upon Medlock and Hulme. By 1846, with increasing population and greater industrialisation, the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the \"Police Commissioners\". In 1853, Manchester was granted city status.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1885, Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme and parts of Moss Side and Withington townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a county borough, as did many larger Lancashire towns, and therefore not governed by Lancashire County Council. Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city, which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as Burnage, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Didsbury, Fallowfield, Levenshulme, Longsight, and Withington. In 1931, the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added. In 1974, by way of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. That year, Ringway, the village where the Manchester Airport is located, was added to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2014, it was announced that Greater Manchester would receive a new directly elected mayor. The mayor would have fiscal control over health, transport, housing and police in the area. Andy Burnham was elected as the first mayor of Greater Manchester in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeography\\r\\nthumb|Manchester skyline with the cathedral and surrounding city buildings\\r\\n\\r\\nAt ,  northwest of London, Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the Pennines, an upland chain that runs the length of northern England, and to the south by the Cheshire Plain. Manchester is  north-east of Liverpool and  north-west of Sheffield, making the city the halfway point between the two. The city centre is on the east bank of the River Irwell, near its confluences with the Rivers Medlock and Irk, and is relatively low-lying, being between  above sea level. The River Mersey flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchester\\'s geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world\\'s first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a seaport at Liverpool, the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby coal reserves.\\r\\nthumb|left|upright|The City of Manchester. The land use is overwhelmingly urban.\\r\\nThe name Manchester, though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester, has been applied to other, wider divisions of land, particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area. The \"Manchester City Zone\", \"Manchester post town\" and the \"Manchester Congestion Charge\" are all examples of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom\\'s third-largest conurbation. There is a mix of high-density urban and suburban locations. The largest open space in the city, at around , is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively in the south of Manchester. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate\\r\\nManchester experiences a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), like much of the British Isles, with warm summers and cold winters compared to other parts of the UK. Summer daytime temperatures regularly top 20°C, quite often reaching 25°C on sunny days during July and August in particular. In more recent years, temperatures have occasionally reached over 30°C. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. The city\\'s average annual rainfall is  compared to a UK average of , and its mean rain days are 140.4 per annum, compared to the UK average of 154.4. Manchester has a relatively high humidity level, and this, along with abundant soft water, was one factor that led to advancement of the textile industry in the area. Snowfalls are not common in the city because of the urban warming effect but the West Pennine Moors to the north-west, South Pennines to the north-east and Peak District to the east receive more snow, which can close roads leading out of the city. They include the A62 via Oldham and Standedge, the A57, Snake Pass, towards Sheffield, and the Pennine section of the M62. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Manchester was  on 7 January 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen belt\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester lies at the centre of a green belt region extending into the wider surrounding counties. This reduces urban sprawl, prevents towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protects the identity of outlying communities, and preserves nearby countryside. It is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to being already highly urban, the city contains limited portions of protected green-belt area within greenfield throughout the borough, with minimal development opportunities, at Clayton Vale, Heaton Park, Chorlton Water Park along with the Chorlton Ees & Ivy Green nature reserve and the floodplain surrounding the River Mersey, as well as the southern area around Manchester Airport. The green belt was first drawn up in 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemographics\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|City of Manchester population pyramid in 2021\\r\\nthumb|UK and foreign born population pyramid of Manchester in 2021. Males and females representing the UK born population while foreign males and females representing the foreign born population.\\r\\nHistorically the population of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era, estimated at 354,930 for Manchester and 110,833 for Salford in 1865, and peaking at 766,311 in 1931. From then the population began to decrease rapidly, due to slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2012 mid-year estimate for the population of Manchester was 510,700. This was an increase of 7,900, or 1.6 per cent, since the 2011 estimate. Since 2001, the population has grown by 87,900, or 20.8 per cent, making Manchester the third fastest-growing area in the 2011 census. The city experienced the greatest percentage population growth outside London, with an increase of 19 per cent to over 500,000. Manchester\\'s population is projected to reach 532,200 by 2021, an increase of 5.8 per cent from 2011. This represents a slower rate of growth than the previous decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greater Manchester Built-up Area in 2011 had an estimated population of 2,553,400. In 2012 an estimated 2,702,200 people lived in Greater Manchester. An 6,547,000 people were estimated in 2012 to live within  of Manchester and 11,694,000 within .\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the beginning of July 2011 and end of June 2012 (mid-year estimate date), births exceeded deaths by 4,800. Migration (internal and international) and other changes accounted for a net increase of 3,100 people between July 2011 and June 2012. Compared with Greater Manchester and with England, Manchester has a younger population, with a particularly large 20–35 age group.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 76,095 undergraduate and postgraduate students at Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of Manchester and Royal Northern College of Music in the 2011/2012 academic year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all households in Manchester, 0.23 per cent were Same-Sex Civil Partnership households, compared with an English national average of 0.16 per cent in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manchester Larger Urban Zone, a Eurostat measure of the functional city-region approximated to local government districts, had a population of 2,539,100 in 2004. In addition to Manchester itself, the LUZ includes the remainder of the county of Greater Manchester. The Manchester LUZ is the second largest within the United Kingdom, behind that of London.\\r\\n\\r\\n Religion \\r\\nSince the 2001 census, the proportion of Christians in Manchester has fallen by 22 per cent from 62.4 per cent to 48.7 per cent in 2011. The proportion of those with no religious affiliation rose by 58.1 per cent from 16 per cent to 25.3 per cent, whilst the proportion of Muslims increased by 73.6 per cent from 9.1 per cent to 15.8 per cent. The size of the Jewish population in Greater Manchester is the largest in Britain outside London.\\r\\n\\r\\n Ethnicity \\r\\nthumb|Population pyramid of Manchester by ethnicity in 2021\\r\\nIn terms of ethnic composition, the City of Manchester has the highest non-white proportion of any district in Greater Manchester. Statistics from the 2011 census showed that 66.7 per cent of the population was White (59.3 per cent White British, 2.4 per cent White Irish, 0.1 per cent Gypsy or Irish Traveller, 4.9 per cent Other White – although the size of mixed European and British ethnic groups is unclear, there are reportedly over 25,000 people in Greater Manchester of at least partial Italian descent alone, which represents 5.5 per cent of the population of Greater Manchester). 4.7 per cent were mixed race (1.8 per cent White and Black Caribbean, 0.9 per cent White and Black African, 1.0 per cent White and Asian, 1.0 per cent other mixed), 17.1 per cent Asian (2.3 per cent Indian, 8.5 per cent Pakistani, 1.3 per cent Bangladeshi, 2.7 per cent Chinese, 2.3 per cent other Asian), 8.6 per cent Black (5.1 per cent African, 1.6 per cent other Black), 1.9 per cent Arab and 1.2 per cent of other ethnic heritage.\\r\\nthumb|The Chinatown Paifang\\r\\nKidd identifies Moss Side, Longsight, Cheetham Hill, Rusholme, as centres of population for ethnic minorities. Manchester\\'s Irish Festival, including a St Patrick\\'s Day parade, is one of Europe\\'s largest. There is also a well-established Chinatown in the city with a substantial number of Chinese restaurants and supermarkets. The area also attracts large numbers of Chinese students to the city who, in attending the local universities, contribute to Manchester having the third-largest Chinese population in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEthnicity of Manchester, from 1971 to 2021:\\r\\nEthnic groupYear1971 estimations1981 estimations1991Data is taken from United Kingdom Casweb Data services of the United Kingdom 1991 Census on Ethnic Data for England, Scotland and Wales (Table 6)200120112021Number%Number%Number%Number%Number%Number%White: Total512,93695.8%396,48792.1%353,68587.4%318,01381%335,10966.6%313,63256.8%White: British––––––292,49874.5%298,23759.3%268,57248.7%White: Irish––––––14,8263.8%11,8432.4%9,4421.7%White: Traveller of Irish heritage––––––––5090.1%5970.1%White: Gypsy/Roma––––––––––8830.2%White: Other––––––10,6892.7%24,5204.9%34,1386.2%Asian / Asian British: Total––––26,7666.6%41,00310.4%85,98617.1%115,10920.9%Asian / Asian British: Indian––––4,4045,81711,4172.3%14,8572.7%Asian / Asian British: Pakistani––––15,3603.8%23,1045.9%42,9048.5%65,87511.9%Asian / Asian British: Bangladeshi––––2,0003,6546,4371.3%9,6731.8%Asian / Asian British: Chinese––––3,1035,12613,5392.7%12,6442.3%Asian / Asian British: Other Asians––––1,8993,30211,6892.3%12,0602.2%Black / Black British: Total––––18,8984.7%17,7394.5%43,4848.6%65,89312%Black: African––––3,4650.9%6,6551.7%25,7185.1%47,8588.7%Black: Caribbean––––10,3902.6%9,0442.3%9,6421.9%10,4721.9%Black: Other Blacks––––5,0432,0408,1241.6%7,5631.4%Mixed / British Mixed––––––12,6733.2%23,1614.6%29,0265.2%White and Black Caribbean––––––5,2958,8771.8%9,9871.8%White and Black African––––––2,4124,3970.9%5,9921.1%White and Asian––––––2,4594,7911%6,1491.1%Any other mixed background––––––2,5075,0961%6,8981.2%Other: Total––––5,5171.4%3,3910.9%15,3873.1%28,2785.1%Other: Arab––––5,5171.4%3,3910.9%9,5031.9%15,0282.7%Other: Any other ethnic group––––––––5,8841.2%13,2502.4%Ethnic minority22,4844.2%33,9447.9%51,18112.6%74,80619%168,01833.4%238,30643.2%Total:535,420100%430,431100%404,866100%392,819100%503,127100%551,938100%\\r\\nEthnicity of school pupils\\r\\nEthnic groupSchool year2004/20052021/2022Number%Number%White: Total34,86064%34,60937.6%White: British33,69861.9%29,59132.2%White: Irish3733200.3%White: Traveller of Irish heritage106870.1%White: Gypsy/Roma232860.3%White: Other6584,3254.7%Asian / Asian British: Total8,89316.3%23,59425.9%Asian / Asian British: Indian7702,1632.4%Asian / Asian British: Pakistani6,20415,83817.3%Asian / Asian British: Bangladeshi9712,1572.4%Asian / Asian British: Chinese3901,0731.2%Asian / Asian British: Other Asians5582,3632.6%Black / Black British: Total4,7008.6%15,69917.1%Black: Caribbean1,5171,3241.4%Black: African2,61811,01412.0%Black: Other Blacks5643,3613.7%Mixed / British Mixed3,5306.5%8,8089.5%Other: Total1,6903.1%7,4488.1%Unclassified7931.5%1,6281.8%Total:54,470100%91,786100%\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomy\\r\\n\\r\\n+GVA for Greater Manchester South 2002–2012 Year  GVA (£ million)  Growth (%) 2002  24,011  3.8% 2003  25,063  4.4% 2004  27,862  11.2% 2005  28,579   2.6% 2006  30,384  6.3% 2007  32,011  5.4% 2008  32,081  0.2% 2009  33,186  3.4% 2010  33,751  1.7% 2011  33,468  0.8% 2012  34,755  3.8% 2013  37,560  9.6%\\r\\nleft|thumb|The Great Jackson Street skyscraper district under construction in Central Manchester\\r\\nThe Office for National Statistics does not produce economic data for the City of Manchester alone, but includes four other metropolitan boroughs, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, in an area named Greater Manchester South, which had a GVA of £34.8\\xa0billion. The economy grew relatively strongly between 2002 and 2012, when growth was 2.3 per cent above the national average. The wider metropolitan economy is the third largest in the United Kingdom.  It is ranked as a beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the UK economy continues to recover from its 2008–2010 downturn, Manchester compares favourably according to recent figures. In 2012 it showed the strongest annual growth in business stock (5 per cent) of all core cities. The city had a relatively sharp increase in the number of business deaths, the largest increase in all the core cities, but this was offset by strong growth in new businesses, resulting in strong net growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester\\'s civic leadership has a reputation for business acumen. It owns two of the country\\'s four busiest airports and uses its earnings to fund local projects. Meanwhile, KPMG\\'s competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nKPMG\\'s competitive alternative report also found that Manchester was Europe\\'s most affordable city featured, ranking slightly better than the Dutch cities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam, which all have a cost-of-living index of less than 95.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester is a city of contrast, where some of the country\\'s most deprived and most affluent neighbourhoods can be found. According to 2010 Indices of Multiple Deprivation, Manchester is the 4th most deprived local council in England. Unemployment throughout 2012–2013 averaged 11.9 per cent, which was above national average, but lower than some of the country\\'s comparable large cities. On the other hand, Greater Manchester is home to more multi-millionaires than anywhere outside London, with the City of Manchester taking up most of the tally. In 2013 Manchester was ranked 6th in the UK for quality of life, according to a rating of the UK\\'s 12 largest cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen fare better in Manchester than the rest of the country in comparative pay with men. The per hours-worked gender pay gap is 3.3 per cent compared with 11.1 per cent for Britain. 37 per cent of the working-age population in Manchester have degree-level qualifications, as opposed to an average of 33 per cent across other core cities, although its schools under-perform slightly compared with the national average.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester has the largest UK office market outside London, according to GVA Grimley, with a quarterly office uptake (averaged over 2010–2014) of some 250,000 square ft – equivalent to the quarterly office uptake of Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle combined and 90,000 square feet more than the nearest rival, Birmingham. The strong office market in Manchester has been partly attributed to \"northshoring\" (from offshoring), which entails the relocation or alternative creation of jobs away from the overheated South to areas where office space is possibly cheaper and the workforce market less saturated.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandmarks\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=0.9|Neo-baroque Lancaster House. Manchester is known for opulent warehouses from the city\\'s textile trade.\\r\\nManchester\\'s buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick characterises the city, much of the architecture of which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade. Just outside the immediate city centre are a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure, while many have been redeveloped as apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is seen as one of the most important Victorian buildings in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester also has a number of skyscrapers built in the 1960s and 1970s, the tallest being the CIS Tower near Manchester Victoria station until the Beetham Tower was completed in 2006. The latter exemplifies a new surge in high-rise building. It includes a Hilton hotel, a restaurant and apartments. The largest skyscraper is now Deansgate Square South Tower, at 201 metres (659 feet).The Green Building, opposite Oxford Road station, is a pioneering eco-friendly housing project, while the recently completed One Angel Square, is one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe award-winning Heaton Park in the north of the city borough is one of the largest municipal parks in Europe, covering  of parkland. The city has 135 parks, gardens, and open spaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo large squares hold many of Manchester\\'s public monuments. Albert Square has monuments to Prince Albert, Bishop James Fraser, Oliver Heywood, William Gladstone and John Bright. Piccadilly Gardens has monuments dedicated to Queen Victoria, Robert Peel, James Watt and the Duke of Wellington. The cenotaph in St Peter\\'s Square is Manchester\\'s main memorial to its war dead. Designed by Edwin Lutyens, it echoes the original on Whitehall in London. The Alan Turing Memorial in Sackville Park commemorates his role as the father of modern computing. A larger-than-life statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Gray Barnard in the eponymous Lincoln Square (having stood for many years in Platt Fields) was presented to the city by Mr and Mrs Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio, to mark the part Lancashire played in the cotton famine and American Civil War of 1861–1865. A Concorde is on display near Manchester Airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester has six designated local nature reserves: Chorlton Water Park, Blackley Forest, Clayton Vale and Chorlton Ees, Ivy Green, Boggart Hole Clough and Highfield Country Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransport\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.2|Map of tram lines, railways and main bus routes in Greater Manchester\\r\\n\\r\\nRail\\r\\nManchester Liverpool Road was the world\\'s first purpose-built passenger and goods railway station and served as the Manchester terminus on the Liverpool & Manchester Railway – the world\\'s first inter-city passenger railway.

In addition, Manchester Mayfield station closed to passenger services in 1960; its buildings and platforms are still extant, next to Piccadilly station, but are due to be redeveloped in the 2020s.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the city is well served by its rail network although it is now working to capacity, and is at the centre of an extensive county-wide railway network, including the West Coast Main Line, with two mainline stations: Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria. The Manchester station group – comprising Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Victoria, Manchester Oxford Road and Deansgate – is the third busiest in the United Kingdom, with 44.9\\xa0million passengers recorded in 2017/2018. The High Speed 2 link to Birmingham and London was also planned, which would have included a  tunnel under Manchester on the final approach into an upgraded Piccadilly station, however this was cancelled by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in October 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent improvements in Manchester as part of the Northern Hub in the 2010s have been numerous electrification schemes into and through Manchester, redevelopment of Victoria station and construction of the Ordsall Chord directly linking Victoria and Piccadilly. Work on two new through platforms at Piccadilly and an extensive upgrade at Oxford Road had not commenced as of 2019. Manchester city centre, specifically the Castlefield Corridor, suffers from constrained rail capacity that frequently leads to delays and cancellations – a 2018 report found that all three major Manchester stations are among the top ten worst stations in the United Kingdom for punctuality, with Oxford Road deemed the worst in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetrolink (tram)\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Manchester Metrolink is the largest tram system in the UK, with a total route length of .\\r\\nManchester became the first city in the UK to acquire a modern light rail tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. In 2016–2017, 37.8\\xa0million passenger journeys were made on the system. The present system mostly runs on former commuter rail lines converted for light rail use, and crosses the city centre via on-street tram lines. The network consists of eight lines with 99 stops. A new line to the Trafford Centre opened in 2020.\"Metrolink\\'s Trafford Park £350m Tramline Approved\" . BBC News. 13 October 2016. Manchester city centre is also serviced by over a dozen heavy and light rail-based park and ride sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nBus\\r\\nthumb|Free buses operate on three Manchester Metroshuttle routes around Manchester city centre.\\r\\nThe city has one of the most extensive bus networks outside London, with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester region radiating from the city. In 2011, 80 per cent of public transport journeys in Greater Manchester were made by bus, amounting to 220\\xa0million passenger journeys each year. After deregulation in 1986, the bus system was taken over by GM Buses, which after privatisation was split into GM Buses North and GM Buses South. Later these were taken over by First Greater Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester. Much of the First Greater Manchester business was sold to Diamond North West and Go North West in 2019. Go North West operate a three-route zero-fare Manchester Metroshuttle, which carries 2.8\\xa0million commuters a year around Manchester\\'s business districts. Stagecoach Manchester is the Stagecoach Group\\'s largest subsidiary and operates around 690 buses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAir\\r\\nthumb|Manchester Airport from above\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester Airport serves Manchester, Northern England and North Wales. The airport is the third busiest in the United Kingdom, with over double the number of annual passengers of the next busiest non-London airport. Services cover many destinations in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than any other airport in Britain). A second runway was opened in 2001 and there have been continued terminal improvements. The airport has the highest rating available: \"Category 10\", encompassing an elite group of airports able to handle \"Code F\" aircraft, including the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8. From September 2010 the airport became one of only 17 airports in the world and the only UK airport other than Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport to operate the Airbus A380.\\r\\n\\r\\nA smaller City Airport Manchester exists  to the west of Manchester city centre. It was Manchester\\'s first municipal airport and became the site of the first air traffic control tower in the UK, and the first municipal airfield in the UK to be licensed by the Air Ministry.

It also has a flight school, and both the Greater Manchester Police Air Support Unit and the North West Air Ambulance have helicopters based there.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanal\\r\\nAn extensive canal network, including the Manchester Ship Canal, was built to carry freight from the Industrial Revolution onward; the canals are still maintained, though now largely repurposed for leisure use. In 2012, plans were approved to introduce a water taxi service between Manchester city centre and MediaCityUK at Salford Quays. It ceased to operate in June 2018, citing poor infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nCycling\\r\\n\\r\\nCycling for transportation and leisure enjoys popularity in Manchester and the city also plays a major role in British cycle racing.\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The Gallagher brothers of Oasis\\r\\nBands that have emerged from the Manchester music scene include Van der Graaf Generator, Oasis, the Smiths, Joy Division and its successor group New Order, Buzzcocks, the Stone Roses, the Fall, the Durutti Column, 10cc, Godley & Creme, the Verve, Elbow, Doves, the Charlatans, M People, the 1975, Simply Red, Take That, Dutch Uncles, Everything Everything, Pale Waves, and the Outfield. Manchester was credited as the main driving force behind British indie music of the 1980s led by the Smiths, later including the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, and James. The later groups came from what became known as the \"Madchester\" scene that also centred on The Haçienda nightclub developed by the founder of Factory Records, Tony Wilson. Although from southern England, the Chemical Brothers subsequently formed in Manchester. Former Smiths frontman Morrissey, whose lyrics often refer to Manchester locations and culture, later found international success as a solo artist. Previously, notable Manchester acts of the 1960s include the Hollies, Herman\\'s Hermits, and Davy Jones of the Monkees (famed in the mid-1960s for their albums and their American TV show), and the earlier Bee Gees, who grew up in Chorlton. Another notable contemporary band from near Manchester is the Courteeners consisting of Liam Fray and four close friends. Singer-songwriter Ren Harvieu is also from Greater Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|The Manchester Arena, the city\\'s premier indoor multi-use venue and one of the largest purpose-built arenas in Europe\\r\\nIts main pop music venue is Manchester Arena, voted \"International Venue of the Year\" in 2007. With over 21,000 seats, it is the largest arena of its type in Europe. In terms of concertgoers, it is the busiest indoor arena in the world, ahead of Madison Square Garden in New York and The O2 Arena in London, which are second and third busiest. Other venues include Manchester Apollo, Albert Hall, Victoria Warehouse and the Manchester Academy. Smaller venues include the Band on the Wall, the Night and Day Café, the Ruby Lounge, and The Deaf Institute. Manchester also has the most indie and rock music events outside London.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester has two symphony orchestras, The Hallé and the BBC Philharmonic, and a chamber orchestra, the Manchester Camerata. In the 1950s, the city was home to a so-called \"Manchester School\" of classical composers, which was composed of Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies, David Ellis and Alexander Goehr. Manchester is a centre for musical education: the Royal Northern College of Music and Chetham\\'s School of Music. Forerunners of the RNCM were the Northern School of Music (founded 1920) and the Royal Manchester College of Music (founded 1893), which merged in 1973. One of the earliest instructors and classical music pianists/conductors at the RNCM, shortly after its founding, was the Russian-born Arthur Friedheim, (1859–1932), who later had the music library at the famed Peabody Institute conservatory of music in Baltimore, Maryland, named after him. The main classical music venue was the Free Trade Hall on Peter Street until the opening in 1996 of the 2,500 seat Bridgewater Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrass band music, a tradition in the north of England, is important to Manchester\\'s musical heritage; some of the UK\\'s leading bands, such as the CWS Manchester Band and the Fairey Band, are from Manchester and surrounding areas, and the Whit Friday brass-band contest takes place annually in the neighbouring areas of Saddleworth and Tameside.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerforming arts\\r\\nthumb|upright|The Opera House, one of Manchester\\'s largest theatre venues\\r\\nManchester has a thriving theatre, opera and dance scene, with a number of large performance venues, including Manchester Opera House, which feature large-scale touring shows and West End productions; the Palace Theatre; and the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester\\'s former cotton exchange, which is the largest theatre in the round in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmaller venues include the Contact Theatre and Z-arts in Hulme. The Dancehouse on Oxford Road is dedicated to dance productions. In 2014, HOME, a new custom-built arts complex opened. Housing two theatre spaces, five cinemas and an art exhibition space, it replaced the Cornerhouse and The Library Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2007 the city has hosted the Manchester International Festival, a biennial international arts festival with a focus on original work, which has included major new commissions by artists, including Bjork. A government statement in 2014 announced a £78\\xa0million grant for a new \"large-scale, ultra-flexible arts space\" for the city. Later the council stated it had secured a further £32\\xa0million. The £110\\xa0million venue was confirmed in July 2016. Pdf.  The theatre, to be called The Factory, after Manchester\\'s Factory Records, will provide a permanent home for the Manchester International Festival.

The work of Stretford-born painter , known for \"matchstick\" paintings of industrial Manchester and Salford, can be seen in the City and Whitworth Manchester galleries, and at the Lowry art centre in Salford Quays (in the neighbouring borough of Salford), which devotes a large permanent exhibition to his works.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterature\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.25|Gaskell House, where Mrs Gaskell wrote most of her novels. The house is now a museum.\\r\\nManchester is a UNESCO City of Literature known for a \"radical literary history\". Manchester in the 19th century featured in works highlighting the changes that industrialisation had brought. They include Elizabeth Gaskell\\'s novel Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life (1848), and studies such as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 by Friedrich Engels, while living and working here. Manchester was the meeting place of Engels and Karl Marx. The two began writing The Communist Manifesto in Chetham\\'s Library – founded in 1653 and claiming to be the oldest public library in the English-speaking world. Elsewhere in the city, the John Rylands Library holds an extensive collection of early printing. The Rylands Library Papyrus P52, believed to be the earliest extant New Testament text, is on permanent display there.\\r\\n\\r\\nLetitia Landon\\'s poetical illustration Manchester to a vista over the city by G. Pickering in Fisher\\'s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835, records the rapid growth of the city and its cultural importance. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Dickens is reputed to have set his novel Hard Times in the city, and though partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Mrs Gaskell. Gaskell penned all her novels but Mary Barton at her home in 84 Plymouth Grove. Often her house played host to influential authors: Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton, for example. It is now open as a literary museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte Brontë began writing her novel Jane Eyre in 1846, while staying at lodgings in Hulme. She was accompanying her father Patrick, who was convalescing in the city after cataract surgery. She probably envisioned Manchester Cathedral churchyard as the burial place for Jane\\'s parents and the birthplace of Jane herself.Alexander, Christine, and Sara L. Pearson.

Also associated with the city is the Victorian poet and novelist Isabella Banks, famed for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man. Anglo-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett was born in the city\\'s Cheetham Hill district in 1849, and wrote much of her classic children\\'s novel The Secret Garden while visiting nearby Salford\\'s Buile Hill Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony Burgess is among the 20th-century writers who made Manchester their home. He wrote here the dystopian satire A Clockwork Orange in 1962.See the essay \"A Prophetic and Violent Masterpiece\" by Theodore Dalrymple in \"Not With a Bang but a Whimper\" (2008) pp. 135–149. Dame Carol Ann Duffy, Poet Laureate from 2009 to 2019, moved to the city in 1996 and lives in West Didsbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nNightlife\\r\\nThe night-time economy of Manchester has expanded significantly since about 1993, with investment from breweries in bars, public houses and clubs, along with active support from the local authorities. The more than 500 licensed premises in the city centre have a capacity to deal with more than  visitors, with 110,000–130,000 people visiting on a typical weekend night, making Manchester the most popular city for events at 79 per thousand people. The night-time economy has a value of about £100\\xa0million, and supports 12,000 jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madchester scene of the 1980s, from which groups including the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and the Charlatans emerged, was based around clubs such as The Haçienda. The period was the subject of the movie 24 Hour Party People.  Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Haçienda closed in 1997.\\r\\nthumb|right|Canal Street, one of Manchester\\'s liveliest nightspots, part of the city\\'s gay village\\r\\n\\r\\nGay village\\r\\nPublic houses in the Canal Street area have had an LGBTQ+ clientele since at least 1940, and now form the centre of Manchester\\'s LGBTQ+ community.

It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The Cheshire campus permanently closed in 2019. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe\\'s largest urban higher-education precinct. Together they have a combined population of over 80,000 students as of 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Manchester\\'s notable secondary schools is Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham\\'s School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme\\'s Grammar School, Withington Girls\\' School and Manchester High School for Girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019, the Manchester Local Education Authority was ranked second to last out of Greater Manchester\\'s ten LEAs and 140th out of 151 in the country LEAs based on the percentage of pupils attaining grades 4 or above in English and mathematics GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education) with 56.2 per cent compared with the national average of 64.9 per cent. Of the 63 secondary schools in the LEA, four had 80 per cent or more pupils achieving Grade 4 or above in English and maths GCSEs: Manchester High School for Girls, The King David High School, Manchester Islamic High School for Girls, and Kassim Darwish Grammar School for Boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nSport\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|upright=1.25|The Etihad Stadium is home to Premier League club Manchester City F.C. and host stadium for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\\r\\nTwo Premier League football clubs bear the city\\'s name – Manchester City and Manchester United.

Until 2008, its head office was still in the city, though many of its management functions were moved to London in 1964. For many years most national newspapers had offices in Manchester: The Daily Telegraph, Daily Express, Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, The Sun. At its height, 1,500 journalists were employed, earning the city the nickname \"second Fleet Street\". In the 1980s the titles closed their northern offices and centred their operations in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main regional newspaper in the city is the Manchester Evening News, which was for over 80 years the sister publication of The Manchester Guardian. The Manchester Evening News has the largest circulation of a UK regional evening newspaper and is distributed free of charge in the city centre on Thursdays and Fridays, but paid for in the suburbs. Despite its title, it is available all day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral local weekly free papers are distributed by the MEN group. The Metro North West is available free at Metrolink stops, rail stations and other busy locations. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAn attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, the North West Times, employing journalists made redundant by other titles, closed in 1988. Another attempt was made with the North West Enquirer, which hoped to provide a true \"regional\" newspaper for the North West, much in the same vein as the Yorkshire Post does for Yorkshire or The Northern Echo does for the North East; it folded in October 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nTelevision\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Granada Studios, the former headquarters of Granada Television\\r\\nManchester has been a centre of television broadcasting since the 1950s.

Although its influence has waned, Granada had been described as \"the best commercial television company in the world\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the growth in regional television in the 1950s, Manchester became one of the BBC\\'s three main centres in England. In 1954, the BBC opened its first regional BBC Television studio outside London, Dickenson Road Studios, in a converted Methodist chapel in Rusholme. The first edition of Top of the Pops was broadcast here on New Year\\'s Day 1964. \\r\\nFrom 1975, BBC programmes including Mastermind, and Real Story, were made at New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road.

Established in 1853, EPFL has placed itself as a university specializing in engineering and natural sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPFL is part of the ETH Domain, which is directly dependent on the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by French engineering school École Centrale Paris, EPFL was established to “train talented engineers in Switzerland”. The school has an urban campus that extends alongside Lake Geneva, and includes the EPFL Innovation Park as well as university research centers and affiliated laboratories.\\r\\n\\r\\n History \\r\\nthumb|left|École spéciale de Lausanne, 1857\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|Louis Rivier, founding member of École spéciale de Lausanne\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roots of modern-day EPFL can be traced back to the foundation of a private school under the name École spéciale de Lausanne in 1853 at the initiative of Lois Rivier, a graduate of the École Centrale Paris and John Gay, the then professor and rector of the Académie de Lausanne. At its inception it had only 11 students and the offices was located at Rue du Valentin in Lausanne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1869, it became the technical department of the  Académie de Lausanne. When the Académie was reorganized and acquired the status of a university in 1890, the technical faculty changed its name to École d\\'ingénieurs de l\\'Université de Lausanne. In 1946, it was renamed the École polytechnique de l\\'Université de Lausanne (EPUL). In 1969, the EPUL was separated from the rest of the University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name. EPFL, like ETH Zurich, is thus directly controlled by the Swiss Federal Council. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, all other universities in Switzerland are controlled by their respective cantonal governments. Following the nomination of Patrick Aebischer as president in 2000, EPFL has started to develop into the field of life sciences. It absorbed the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1946, there were 360 students at EPFL. In 1969, the university had grown to 1,400 students and 55 faculty members. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past two decades, EPFL has grown rapidly in reputation and size. As of 2023, EPFL has more than 13,000 full-time students.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe environment at modern day EPFL is highly international with the school  attracting  students and researchers from all over the world. More than 125 countries are represented on the campus and the university has two official languages, French and English.\\r\\n\\r\\n Academics \\r\\n\\r\\nAdmission\\r\\n\\r\\nHolders of a Swiss \"maturité gymnasiale\" are directly accepted with no other condition in the first year of their Bachelor\\'s program of choice. \\r\\n\\r\\nHolders of a Swiss Professional \"Maturité\" or a Swiss specialised \"Maturité\" are accepted in the Cours de mathématiques spéciales (CMS) within the places available.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs such, EPFL is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedure for Swiss residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, international students are required to have a final grade average of 80% or above of the maximum grade of the upper secondary school national system. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe real selection process happens during the first year of undergraduate studies. This period is called the propaedeutic cycle and the students must pass a block examination of all the courses taken during the first year at the end of the cycle. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the weighted average is insufficient, a student is required to retake the entire first year of coursework if they wish to continue their studies EPFL. Roughly 60% of students fail the first year at EPFL all majors combined, and many choose to drop out rather than to repeat the propaedeutic cycle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe failure rate differs between majors, it is higher for Life Sciences Engineering, Physics and Electrical Engineering where only 30–40% of students pass the first year.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor foreign students, the selection procedure towards the undergraduate program is rather strict, and since most undergraduate courses are taught in French, foreign students must provide documentation of having acquired a level B2 proficiency in French as measured on the CEFR scale, though C1 proficiency is recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual time till graduation is six semesters (3 years) for the Bachelor of Science degree and four additional semesters (2 years) for the Master of Science degree with the final semester dedicated to writing a thesis. Though only 58% of the students who manage to graduate are able to graduate within this time-period. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility to study abroad for one or two semesters is offered during the 3rd year of studies as EPFL maintains several long-standing student exchange programs, such as the junior year engineering and science program with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, as well as a graduate Aeronautics and Aerospace program with the ISAE in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntrepreneurship is actively encouraged at EPFL, as evident by the EPFL Innovation Park being an integral part of the campus. Since 1997, 12 start-ups have been created per year on average by EPFL students and faculty. In the year 2013, a total of 105 million CHF was raised by EPFL start-ups.\\r\\n\\r\\n Rankings  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, the QS World University Rankings ranks EPFL 16th worldwide across all fields, and among the 10 best universities in several engineering disciplines. Times Higher Education ranks EPFL as the world\\'s 19th best school in the world for Engineering and Technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPFL typically scores high on faculty to student ratio, international outlook and scientific impact. The CWTS Leiden Ranking that \"aims to provide highly accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities\" ranks EPFL world 13th, and 1st in Europe in the 2013 rankings for all the sciences. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe Times 100 Under 50 Rankings is a ranking of the top 100 universities in the world under 50 years old.

The inauguration of the first EPFL buildings of the new campus took place in 1978.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EPFL campus has been evolving ever since. The first stage of development, with a total budget of 462 million Swiss francs, was completed in 1984; the second in 1990. \\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the northern parts of campus began in 1995 with the Microtechnology building (BM), completed in 1998, and the architecture building (SG), completed in 2000. In 2002, the department of architecture also moved to the campus in Écublens, uniting all departments of EPFL on the same site. The latest addition to the EPFL campus is the Rolex Learning Center completed in February 2010. The Rolex Learning Center is the main campus library and includes areas for work, leisure and services and is located at the center of the campus. The campus has also been expanded with the construction of the SwissTech Convention Center inaugurated in March 2014. As of 2022, RTS began the construction of a regional production center on campus in collaboration with EPFL.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether with the University of Lausanne, EPFL forms a vast campus complex at the shores of Lake Geneva with about 20,000 students combined. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe campus is served by the Lausanne Metro Line 1 (M1) and is equipped with an electric bicycle sharing system.Campus roule, www.publibike.ch (page visited on 15 May 2013). Since 2012, only electricity from certified hydroelectric generation is being bought by EPFL to power its campus. The university was the first campus to receive the International Sustainable Campus Excellence Award by the International Sustainable Campus Network.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 14,000 people that work and study at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne campus, roughly 9.300 are students in either Bachelor, Master or Doctoral programs, the remaining 4,700 being administrative staff, scientists, technical staff, professors and the entrepreneurs located in the Science Park EPFL7. More than 125 nationalities are represented on campus with 48% of the student population being foreign nationals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all of the structures are on its main campus.

It is a hilly city situated on the shores of Lake Geneva, about halfway between the Jura Mountains and the Alps, and facing the French town of Évian-les-Bains across the lake. Lausanne is located  northeast of Geneva, the nearest major city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe municipality of Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland after Basel, Geneva, and Zurich, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, Valais and foreign parts), commonly designated as Arc lémanique was over 1.3\\xa0million inhabitants in 2017 and is the fastest growing in Switzerland.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially a Celtic and Roman settlement on the shores of the lake, Lausanne became a town at the foot of Notre Dame, a cathedral built in the 12th century. In the 20th century, Lausanne became a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. The city has a 28-station metro system, making it the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called , at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called  or  (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as  and in 280 as . By 400, it was , and in 990 it was mentioned as .\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb| Square, \\r\\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Counts of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 888 to 1032, the initially relatively small town belonged to the kingdom of Upper Burgundy. During the 11th century, Lausanne developed into a political, economic and religious center. The city became the center of the secular rule of the bishops. In the period that followed, especially in the 12th and 13th centuries, Lausanne flourished. Finally, in 1275, the Lausanne Cathedral was consecrated in the presence of Pope Gregory X and King Rudolf I of Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was invaded by forces from the canton of Bern and remained under their domination from 1536 to 1798. The iconoclastic Bernese stripped the Lausanne cathedral of its Roman Catholic trappings, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the cathedral, were permanently removed.They are preserved in the Bern Historical Museum. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them, but they never were returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. Also  During the Napoleonic Wars, the city\\'s status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton of Vaud under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern history and heritage\\r\\nIn 1923, the city was the venue for the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, which established the modern Turkish Republic. In 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial suburb of Renens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem The Waste Land (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people – such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron — have sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the Lôzane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\".\"Tired of being bored\", The Lausanner 3 (English, Summer/Autumn 2019), 17. https://static.mycity.travel/manage/uploads/6/30/102741/1/the-lausanner-summer-autumn-2019-n0-3.pdf Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June of 2022, Lausanne launched Plateforme 10, an art district comprising three museums. The trio of museums included Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts (MCBA), Photo Elysée, and the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts (MUDAC). \\r\\n\\r\\nGeography\\r\\n\\r\\nTopography\\r\\nthumb|The agglomeration of Lausanne, Lake Geneva and the Alps.The most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (Le Léman in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about  between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and Épalinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Swiss and Savoyan Alps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present Rue Centrale, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, tourists should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street in which they are trying to go. The name Flon is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-à-Gobet () as well as the exclave of Vernand.\\r\\n\\r\\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la Côte (to the west).\\r\\n\\r\\nLausanne has an area, , of  (depending on calculation method). Of this area,  or 15.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while  or 38.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land,  or 45.9% is settled (buildings or roads),  or 0.2% is either rivers or lakes and  or 0.0% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2018 data  accessed 26 July 2020\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 22.8% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.4%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.6% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.4%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 9.4% is used for growing crops and 4.9% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes and streams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe municipality was part of the old Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz .

University of Munich (TUM or TU Munich; ) is a public research university in Munich, Germany. It specializes in engineering, technology, medicine, and applied and natural sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstablished in 1868 by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, the university now has additional campuses in Garching, Freising, Heilbronn, Straubing, and Singapore, with the Garching campus being its largest. The university is organized into eight schools and departments, and is supported by numerous research centers. It is one of the largest universities in Germany, with 50,467 students and an annual budget of €1,839.2 million including the university hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nA University of Excellence under the German Universities Excellence Initiative, TUM is considered one of the top universities in Germany according to major rankings and is among the leading universities in the European Union. Its researchers and alumni include 18 Nobel laureates and 23 Leibniz Prize winners.\\r\\n\\r\\n History \\r\\n 19th century \\r\\nthumb|The new building of the Polytechnische Schule München in 1869\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1868, King Ludwig II of Bavaria founded the Polytechnische Schule München with Karl Maximilian von Bauernfeind as founding director. The new school had its premises at Arcisstraße, where it is still located today. At that time, around 350 students were supervised by 24 professors and 21 lecturers. The institution was divided into six departments: The \"General Department\" (mathematics, natural sciences, humanities, law and economics), the \"Engineering Department\" (civil engineering and surveying), the \"Building Construction Department\" (architecture), the \"Mechanical-Technical Department\" (mechanical engineering), the \"Chemical-Technical Department\" (chemistry), and the \"Agricultural Department\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1877, the Polytechnische Schule München became the Technische Hochschule München (TH München), and in 1901 it was granted the right to award doctorates. With an average of 2,600 to 2,800 students, the TH München became for a time Germany\\'s largest technical university, ahead of the TH Berlin. In 1970 the institution was renamed Technische Universität München.\\r\\n\\r\\n 20th century \\r\\nthumb|left|The main building of the Technische Hochschule München in 1909\\r\\nthumb|Lecture hall in the former Institute of Chemistry in 1909. An early version of the periodic table can be seen on the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1906, Anna Boyksen became the first female student to enroll in electrical engineering, after the Bavarian government had allowed women to study at technical universities in the German Empire. \\r\\nMartha Schneider-Bürger became the first German female civil engineer to graduate from the university in 1927.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1913, Jonathan Zenneck became director of the newly created Physics Institute.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Weimar Republic, the TH München faced the challenge of limited resources and was drawn into radical political conflicts during the November Revolution, the Great Depression, and the rise of Adolf Hitler. Two of the 16 Nazis killed in Hitler\\'s failed coup attempt in 1923 were students at the university. The National Socialist German Students\\' League became the strongest faction in the General Students\\' Committee in 1930, and Jewish and politically unpopular professors were terrorized by the young students.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Hitler took power, the TH was soon aligned and a \"Führer rector\" was appointed, with the deans directly responsible to him. The Führerprinzip was also imposed on universities, resulting in a significant restriction of the autonomy of the TH München. In 1933, the newly enacted Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service led to the dismissal of staff deemed \"non-Aryan\" or married to \"non-Aryans,\" as well as politically \"undesirable\" professors. Jewish students lost their rights and were banned from enrolling after 1938.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university was deeply involved in the crimes of the Nazi regime. For instance, Heinz Henseler, a professor in charge of animal breeding at the university, headed a new \"Colonial Science Seminar\" from 1940. The seminar focused on exploring how to \"Germanize\" the landscapes of Poland and Russia for future colonization and settlement during the war. The entire Faculty of Agriculture was influenced by the ideology of blood and soil, and agricultural scientists had no qualms about using forced laborers and prisoners of war on university experimental farms. Henseler repeatedly asked his former student and SS chief Heinrich Himmler for additional land and led several excursions to the SS herb garden on the grounds of the Dachau concentration camp with his students.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the TH München conducted extensive research in armaments to support the war effort. Notable professors during this time included aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt and physicist Walther Meissner. Despite the war, high-level basic research continued to be conducted in some institutes, as some professors, staff members, and students dared to disobey and resist. Nobel laureate Hans Fischer protected Jewish students from Nazi persecution. He committed suicide shortly before the end of the war.Pabst, p. 321–350\\r\\n\\r\\n Post World War II \\r\\nthumb|The research reactor FRM I, nicknamed the atomic egg, has become a landmark of the city of Garching, even being featured in its coat of arms.\\r\\nDuring the war, 80 percent of the university\\'s facilities in Munich had been destroyed.  Under these difficult conditions, teaching resumed in April 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1956, the construction of a research reactor in Garching was the beginning of the Garching campus. In 1969, the physics department building was opened there, followed in 1977 by new buildings for the chemistry, biology and geoscience departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967, a Faculty of Medicine was founded with campuses in Haidhausen (Rechts der Isar Hospital) and Schwabing. By 1968, the TH München comprised six faculties, 8,400 students, and 5,700 staff.

With a population of 1,578,132 inhabitants as of 31 May 2022, it is the third-largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and thus the largest which does not constitute its own state, as well as the 11th-largest city in the European Union. The city\\'s metropolitan region is home to about 6 million people.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraddling the banks of the River Isar north of the Alps, Munich is the seat of the Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most densely populated municipality in Germany with 4,500 people per km2. Munich is the second-largest city in the Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of Vienna.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was first mentioned in 1158. Catholic Munich strongly resisted the Reformation and was a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years\\' War, but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes. Once Bavaria was established as Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806, Munich became a major European centre of arts, architecture, culture and science. In 1918, during the German Revolution of 1918–19, the ruling House of Wittelsbach, which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic was declared. In the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the Nazi Party. After the Nazis\\' rise to power, Munich was declared their \"Capital of the Movement\". The city was heavily bombed during World War II, but has restored most of its old town. After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of Wirtschaftswunder. The city hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Munich is a global centre of science, technology, finance, innovation, business, and tourism. Munich enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey, and being rated the world\\'s most liveable city by the Monocle\\'s Quality of Life Survey 2018. Munich is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in Germany in terms of real estate prices and rental costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2021, 28.8 percent of Munich\\'s residents were foreigners, and another 17.7 percent were German citizens with a migration background from a foreign country. Munich\\'s economy is based on high tech, automobiles, and the service sector, as well as IT, biotechnology, engineering, and electronics. It has one of the strongest economies of any German city and the lowest unemployment rate of all cities in Germany with more than 1 million inhabitants. The city houses many multinational companies, such as BMW, Siemens, Allianz SE and Munich Re. In addition, Munich is home to two research universities, and a multitude of scientific institutions. Munich\\'s numerous architectural and cultural attractions, sports events, exhibitions and its annual Oktoberfest, the world\\'s largest Volksfest, attract considerable tourism.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Coat of arms of Munich\\r\\nthumb|The unofficial city anthem of Munich, recorded in 1929\\r\\n\\r\\nEtymology\\r\\nMunich was a tiny 8th-century friar settlement, which was named zu den Munichen (to the Monks). The Old High German Muniche served as basis for the modern German city name München.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrehistory\\r\\nThe river Isar was a prehistoric trade route and in the Bronze Age Munich was among the largest raft ports in Europe. Bronze-Age settlements up to four millennia old have been discovered.

The Duke of Saxony and Bavaria Henry the Lion founded the town of Munich in his territory to control the salt trade, after having burned down the town of Föhring and its bridges over the river Isar. Historians date this event at about 1158. The layout of Munich city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of Höxter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home somewhat upstream at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbrücke is now located.Peter Klimesch: Münchner Isarinseln – Geschichte, Gegenwart und Zukunft.

However, on 14 June 1158, in Augsburg, the conflict was settled in favor of Duke Henry. The Augsburg Arbitration mentions the name of the location in dispute as forum apud Munichen. Although Bishop Otto had lost his bridge, the arbiters ordered Duke Henry to pay a third of his income to the Bishop in Freising as compensation.Wolf-Armin Freiherr von Reitzenstein (2006), \"München\", Lexikon bayerischer Ortsnamen.

Archaeological excavations at Marienhof Square (near Marienplatz) in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn (subway) in 2012 discovered shards of vessels from the 11th century, which prove again that the settlement of Munich must be older than the Augsburg Arbitration of 1158.Archaeological Showcase at the Münchner Stadtmuseum: Discoveries from the Marienhof excavations (2011/2012)  |date=7 November 2021 }}Ausgrabungen und Dokumentation – Vergangenheit aus dem Boden.

In 1180, after Henry the Lion\\'s fall from grace with Emperor Frederick Barbarosa, including his trial and exile, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the Bishop of Freising. In 1240, Munich was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuke Louis IV, a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city\\'s position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 February 1327, a large fire broke out in Munich that lasted two days and destroyed about a third of the town.Bayerischer Architekten- und Ingenieurverein (Hrsg.): München und seine Bauten.

The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court. The Renaissance movement beset Munich and the Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach under the Duke of Bavaria Albrecht V bolstered their prestige by conjuring up a lineage that reached back to Classical antiquity. In 1568 Albrecht V built the Antiquarium to house the Wittelsbach collection of Greek and Roman antiquities in the Munich Residenz. Albrecht V appointed the composer Orlando di Lasso as director of the court orchestra and tempted numerous Italian musicians to work at the Munich court, establishing Munich as a hub for late Renaissance music. During the rule of Duke William V Munich began to be called the \"German Rome\" and William V began presenting Emperor Charlemagne as ancestor of the Wittelsbach dynasty.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuke William V further cemented the Wittelsbach rule by commissioning the Jesuit Michaelskirche. He had the sermons of his Jesuit court preacher Jeremias Drexel translated from Latin into German and published them to a greater audience. William V was addressed with the epithet \"the Pious\" and like his contemporary Wittelsbach dukes promoted himself as \"father of the land\" (Landesvater), encouraged pilgrimages and Marian devotions. William V had the Hofbräuhaus built in 1589. It would become the prototype for beer halls across Munich. After World War II the Residenze, the Hofbräuhaus, the Frauenkirche, and the Peterskirche were reconstructed to look exactly as they did before the Nazi Party seized power in 1933.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|Marienplatz, Munich, about 1650\\r\\nthumb|upright|Banners with the colours of Munich (left) and Bavaria (right) with the Frauenkirche in the background\\r\\nThe Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609. In 1623, during the Thirty Years\\' War (1618–1648), Munich became an electoral residence when Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the electoral dignity, but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II Adolph of Sweden.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1634 Swedish and Spanish troops advanced on Munich. Maximilian I published a plague ordinance to halt an epidemic escalation. The bubonic plague nevertheless ravaged Munich and the surrounding countryside in 1634 and 1635. During the Thirty Years\\' War (1618-1648) troops again converged on Munich in 1647 and precautions were taken, so as to avoid another epidemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of Baroque life, but also had to suffer under Habsburg occupations in 1704 and 1742. When Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria died in 1745, the succession empowered the Palatinate branch within the House of Wittelsbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1777 Bavarian lands were inherited to Karl Theodor, Duke in Bavaria. The new Duke was disliked by the citizens of Munich for his supposedly enlightened ideas. In 1785 Karl Theodor invited Count Rumford Benjamin Thompson to take up residency in Munich and implement stringent social reforms. The poor were forced to live in newly built workhouses. The Bavarian army was restructured, with common soldiers receiving better food and reassurances that they would be treated humanely by officers. Munich was the largest German city to lose fortification in the 1790s. In 1791 Karl Theodor and Count Rumford started to demolish Munich\\'s fortifications. After 1793 Munich\\'s citizens, including house servants, carpenters, butchers, merchants, and court officials, seized the opportunity, building new houses, stalls, and sheds outside the city walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter making an alliance with Napoleonic France, the city became the capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806 with Elector Maximillian Joseph becoming its first King. The state parliament (the Landtag) and the new archdiocese of Munich and Freising were also located in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe establishment of Bavarian state sovereignty profoundly affected Munich. Munich became the center of a modernizing kingdom, and one of the king\\'s first acts was the secularization of Bavaria. He had dissolved all monasteries in 1802 and once crowned, Max Joseph I generated state revenues by selling off church lands. While many monasteries were reestablished, Max Joseph I succeeded in controlling the right to brew beer (Brauchrecht). The king handed the brewing monopoly to Munich\\'s wealthiest brewers, who in turn paid substantial taxs on their beer production. In 1807 the king abolished all ordinances that limited the number of apprentices and journeymen a brewery could employ. Munich\\'s population had swelled and Munich brewers were now free to employ as many workers as they needed to meet the demand. In October 1810 a beer festival was held on the meadows just outside Munich to commemorate the wedding of the crown price and princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The parades in regional dress (Tracht) represented the diversity of the kingdom. The fields are now part of the Theresienwiese and the celebrations developed into Munich\\'s annual Oktoberfest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bavarian state proceeded to take control over the beer market, by regulating all taxes on beer in 1806 and 1811. Brewers and the beer taverns (Wirtshäuser) were taxed, and the state also controlled the quality of beer while limiting the competition among breweries. In 1831 the king\\'s government introduced a cost-of-living allowance on beer for lower-ranking civil servants and soldiers. Soldiers stationed in Munich were granted a daily allowance for beer in the early 1840s. By the 1850s beer had become essential staple food for Munich\\'s working and lower classes. Since the Middle Ages beer had been regarded as nutritious liquid bread (fließendes Brot) in Bavaria. But Munich suffered from poor water sanitation and as early as the 1700s beer came to be regarded as the fifth element. Beer was essential in maintaining public health in Munich and in the mid-1840s Munich police estimated that at least 40,000 residents relied primarily on beer for their nutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\n225px|thumb|The Palace of Justice in Baroque Revival style\\r\\nIn 1832 Peter von Hess painted the Greek War of Independence at the order of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Ludwig I had the Königsplatz built in neoclassicism as a matter of ideological choice. Leo von Klenze supervised the construction of a Propylaia between 1854 and 1862.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early to mid-19th century, the old fortified city walls of Munich were largely demolished due to population expansion.Brigitte Huber: Mauern, Tore Bastionen. München und seine Befestigungen. Hrsg.: Historischer Verein von Oberbayern. Volk Verlag, München 2015,  The first Munich railway station was built in 1839, with a line going to Augsburg in the west. By 1849 a newer Munich Central Train Station (München Hauptbahnhof) was completed, with a line going to Landshut and Regensburg in the north.Bernhard Ücker: Die bayrische Eisenbahn 1835–1920. Süddeutscher Verlag, München, ISBN 3-7991-6255-0Siegfried Bufe: Hauptbahn München–Regensburg. Bufe Fachbuchverlag, Egglham 1997, ISBN 3-922138-61-6. In 1825 Ludwig I had ascended to the throne and commissioned leading architects such as Leo von Klenze to design a series of public museums in neoclassical style. The grand building projects of Ludwig I got Munich the endearment \"Isar-Athen\" and \"Monaco di Bavaria\". Between 1856 and 1861 the court gardener Carl von Effner landscaped the banks of river Isar and established the Maximilian Gardens. In 1857 the construction of the Maximilianeum was started.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time Ludwig II became king in 1864, he remained mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside, which is why he is known the world over as the \\'fairytale king\\'. Ludwig II tried to lure Richard Wagner to Munich, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council. Ludwig II nevertheless generated a windfall for Munich\\'s craft and construction industries. In 1876 Munich hosted the first German Art and Industry Exhibition, which showcased the northern Neo-Renaissance fashion that came to be the German Empire\\'s predominant style. Munich based artists put on the German National Applied Arts Exhibition in 1888, showcasing Baroque Revival architecture and Rococo Revival designs.\\r\\nthumb|right|Jugendstil style house at Leopoldstr. 77, Münchner Freiheit\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1900 Wilhelm Röntgen moved to Munich, he was appointed as professor of Physics. In 1901 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prince Regent Luitpold\\'s reign from 1886 till 1912 was marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich. At the dawn of the 20th century Munich was an epicenter for the Jugendstil movement, combining a liberal magazine culture with progressive industrial design and architecture. The German art movement took its name from the Munich magazine Die Jugend (The Youth). Prominent Munich Jugendstil artists include Hans Eduard von Berlepsch-Valendas, Otto Eckmann, Margarethe von Brauchitsch, August Endell, Hermann Obrist, Wilhelm von Debschitz, and Richard Riemerschmid. In 1905 two large department stores opened in Munich, the Kaufhaus Oberpollinger and the Warenhaus Hermann Tietz, both had been designed by the architect Max Littmann. In 1911 the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter was established in Munich. Its founding members include Gabriele Münter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War I to World War II\\r\\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1916, the \\'Bayerische Motoren Werke\\' (BMW) produced its first aircraft engine in Munich. The stock cooperation BMW AG was founded in 1918, with Camillo Castiglioni owning one third of the share capital. In 1922 BMW relocated its headquarters to a factory in Munich.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War I, the city was at the centre of substantial political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of the German revolution, Ludwig III of Bavaria and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. The November 1918 revolution ended the reign of the Wittelsbach in Bavaria. In Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler described his political activism in Munich after November 1918 as the \"Beginning of My Political Activity\". Hitler called the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic \"the rule of the Jews\". In 1919 Bavaria Film was founded and in the 1920s Munich offered film makers an alternative to Germany\\'s largest film studio in Babelsberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Unrest during the Beer Hall Putsch\\r\\nIn 1923 Gustav von Kahr was appointed Bavarian prime minister and immediately planned for the expulsion of all Jews that did not hold German citizenship. Chief of Police Ernst Pöhner and Wilhelm Frick openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences. In 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler\\'s arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party (NSDAP).\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich was chosen as capital for the Free State of Bavaria and acquired increased responsibility for administering the city itself and the surrounding districts. Offices needed to be built for bureaucracy, so a 12-story office building was erected in the southern part of the historic city centre in the late 1920s.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich again became important to the Nazis when they took power in Germany in 1933. The party created its first concentration camp at Dachau,  north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the Hauptstadt der Bewegung (\"Capital of the Movement\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSDAP headquarters and the documentation apparatus for controlling all aspects of life were located in Munich. Nazi organizations, such as the National Socialist Women\\'s League and the Gestapo, had their offices along Brienner Straße and around the Königsplatz. The party acquired 68 buildings in the area and many Führerbauten (\"Führer buildings\") were built to reflect a new aesthetic of power. Construction work for the Führerbau and the party headquarters (known as the Brown House) started in September 1933. The Haus der Kunst (House of German Art) was the first building to be commissioned by Hitler. The architect Paul Troost was asked to start work shortly after the Nazis had seized power because \"the most German of all German cities\" was left with no exhibition building when in 1931 the Glass Palace was destroyed in an arson. The Red Terror that supposedly preceded Nazi control in Munich, was detailed in Nazi publications, seminal accounts are that of Rudolf Schricker Rotmord über München published in 1934, and Die Blutchronik des Marxismus in Deutschland by Adolf Ehrt and Hans Roden.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1930 Feinkost Käfer was founded in Munich, the Käfer catering business is now a world leading party service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was the site where the 1938 Munich Agreement signed between the United Kingdom and the Third French Republic with Nazi Germany as part of the Franco-British policy of appeasement. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain assented to the German annexation of Czechoslovakia\\'s Sudetenland in the hopes of satisfying Hitler\\'s territorial expansion.Cole, Robert A. \"Appeasing Hitler: The Munich Crisis of 1938: A Teaching and Learning Resource,\" New England Journal of History (2010) 66#2 pp 1–30\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Munich-Riem Airport was completed in October 1939.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 8, 1939, shortly after the Second World War had begun, Georg Elser planted a bomb in the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, who held a political party speech. Hitler, however, had left the building minutes before the bomb went off.Moorhouse, Roger, Killing Hitler: The Third Reich and the Plots against the Führer. Jonathan Cape, 2006, pp. 36–58. ISBN 0-224-07121-1 By mid 1942 the majority of Jews living in Munich and the suburbs had been deported.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich was the base of the White Rose, a student resistance movement. The group had distributed leaflets in several cities and following the 1943 Battle of Stalingrad members of the group stenciled slogans such as \"Down with Hitler\" and \"Hitler the Mass Murderer\" on public buildings in Munich. The core members were arrested and executed after Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl were caught distributing leaflets on Munich University campus calling upon the youth to rise against Hitler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was heavily damaged by the bombing of Munich in World War II, with 71 air raids over five years. US troops liberated Munich on April 30, 1945.Liberation of Munich April 30, 1945 (Video)\\r\\n\\r\\nPostwar\\r\\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Germany and Japan were subject to US Military occupation. After US occupation Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid, bar a few exceptions owing to then modern traffic concepts. In 1957, Munich\\'s population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname Heimliche Hauptstadt (\"secret capital\") in the decades after World War II. In Munich, the Bayerischer Rundfunk began its first television broadcast in 1954.Das Fernsehen kommt – 1953 bis 1969\" (in German). BR. Retrieved 22 July 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Free State of Bavaria used the arms industry as kernel for its high tech development policy. Since 1963, Munich has been hosting the Munich Security Conference, held annually in the Hotel Bayerischer Hof. Munich also became known on the political level due to the strong influence of Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss from the 1960s to the 1980s. The Munich Airport, which commenced operations in 1992, was named in his honor.Peter Siebenmorgen: Franz Josef Strauß, Ein Leben im Übermaß.

Kunzelmann was also active in West Berlin, and became known for using situationist avant-garde as a cover for political violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|A view from the Olympic Tower (Olympiaturm) of the adjacent Olympic Village\\r\\nMunich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics. After winning the bid in 1966 the Mayor of Munich Hans-Jochen Vogel accelerated the construction of the U-Bahn subway and the S-Bahn metropolitan commuter railway. In May 1967 the construction work began for a new U-Bahn line connecting the city with the Olympic Park. The Olympic Park subway station was built near the BMW Headquarters and the line was completed May 1972, three months before the opening of the 1972 Summer Olympics. Shortly before the opening ceremony, Munich also inaugurated a sizable pedestrian priority zone between Karlsplatz and Marienplatz. In 1970 the Munich city council released funds so that the iconic gothic facade and Glockenspiel of the New City Hall (Neues Rathaus) could be restored.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1972 Summer Olympics 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the Munich massacre, when gunmen from the Palestinian \"Black September\" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most deadly militant attack the Federal Republic of Germany has ever witnessed, was the Oktoberfest bombing. The attack was eventually blamed on militant Neo-Nazism.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The Nockherberg beer garden\\r\\nMunich and its urban sprawl emerged as leading German high tech region during the 1980s and 1990s. The urban economy of Munich became characterized by a dynamic labour market, low unemployment, a growing service economy and high per capita income. Munich is home of the famous Nockherberg Strong Beer Festival during the Lenten fasting period (usually in March). Its origins go back to the 17th/18th century, but has become popular when the festivities were first televised in the 1980s. The fest includes comical speeches and a mini-musical in which numerous German politicians are parodied by look-alike actors.Hannes Burger: 350 Jahre Paulaner-Salvator-Thomasbräu AG. 1634–1984.

The renaturation of the Isar allows for the near natural development of the river bed and is part of Munich\\'s flood protection. About 20 percent of buildings in Munich now have a green roof, the Munich city council has been encouraging better stormwater management since the 1990s with regulations and subsidies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the fifth anniversary of the 2011 Norway attacks an active shooter perpetrated a hate crime.

The local rivers are the Isar and the Würm. Munich is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with morainic hills. Between these are fields of fluvio-glacial out-wash, such as around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the north of Munich.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate\\r\\nMunich is located in close proximity of the Alps. Munich has an oceanic climate (Cfb) under the Köppen climate classification. Annual variation in temperature can be significant, as there is no substantial bodies of water nearby. The winter in Munich can be cold and overcast, while some Munich winters can be marked by snow and frost. In Munich, January is the coldest month, night time temperature can be as low as −5 Celsius and even lower. In Munich the summer is usually pleasantly warm, with temperatures averaging 23 Celsius. But, Munich summers can average up to 28 Celsius, topping 30 Celsius on average. During extreme heat summers in Munich, rain and thunderstorms are normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich is subject to active convective seasons and on occasion damaging events. The Alpine thunderstorm system moves along the mountain range, or detaches, heading east-north-east over the foothills of the Alps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Munich\\'s official weather stations, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are , on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and , on 12 February 1929 in the Botanic Garden of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimate change\\r\\nIn Munich, the general trend of global warming with a rise of medium yearly temperatures of about 1\\xa0°C in Germany over the last 120 years can be observed as well. In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20\\xa0°C (tropical nights), a change in precipitation patterns, as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy rain, is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change. The city administration decided to support a joint study from its own Referat für Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the German Meteorological Service that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in Munich. With the help of those programs issues regarding spatial planning and settlement density, the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning ventilation in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemographics\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom only 24,000 inhabitants in 1700, the city population doubled about every 30 years. It was 100,000 in 1852, 250,000 in 1883 and 500,000 in 1901. Since then, Munich has become Germany\\'s third-largest city. In 1933, 840,901 inhabitants were counted, and in 1957 over 1\\xa0million. Munich has reached 1.5\\xa0million in 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration\\r\\nIn July 2017, Munich had 1.42\\xa0million inhabitants; 421,832 foreign nationals resided in the city as of 31 December 2017 with 50.7% of these residents being citizens of EU member states, and 25.2% citizens in European states not in the EU (including Russia and Turkey). Along with the Turks, the Croats are one of the two largest foreign minorities in the city, which is why some Croats refer to Munich as their \"second capital.\" The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (39,204), Croats (33,177), Italians (27,340), Greeks (27,117), Poles (27,945), Austrians (21,944), and Romanians (18,085).\\r\\n+ Foreign residents by citizenship, 2020 Country Population39,74537,20728,49626,61321,55920,74118,84518,63917,83314,28313,63612,35411,22811,09310,6509,5269,4149,2408,7697,4466,7055,2894,6144,297\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion\\r\\nAbout 45% of Munich\\'s residents are not affiliated with any religious group; this ratio represents the fastest growing segment of the population.

The number of districts is about 50, and if smaller units are counted as well, there are about 90 to 100 (see map). The three largest districts are Schwabing in the north (about 110,000 inhabitants), Sendling in the southwest (about 100,000 inhabitants), and Giesing in the south (about 80,000 inhabitants).\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The New Town Hall and Marienplatz\\r\\nthumb|Frauenkirche\\r\\nViktualienmarkt with the Altes Rathaus|thumb\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Town\\r\\nthumb|The Ruffinihaus at Rindermarkt\\r\\nAt the centre of the old town is the Marienplatz with the Old Town Hall and the New Town Hall. Its tower contains the Rathaus-Glockenspiel. The Peterskirche is the oldest church of the inner city. Nearby St. Peter the Gothic hall-church Heiliggeistkirche was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the Viktualienmarkt. Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive, these are the Isartor, the Sendlinger Tor, and the Karlstor. The Karlstor leads up to the Stachus, a square dominated by the Justizpalast (Palace of Justice).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frauenkirche serves as the cathedral for the Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. The nearby Michaelskirche is the largest renaissance church north of the Alps, while the Theatinerkirche is a basilica in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on southern German baroque architecture. Its dome dominates the Odeonsplatz.\\r\\n\\r\\nPalaces and castles\\r\\nThe Schloss Nymphenburg (Nymphenburg Palace) and the smaller Schloss Fürstenried (Fürstenried Palace) were erected around the same time in Munich. Northwest of Nymphenburg Palace is Schloss Blutenburg (Blutenburg Castle).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large Munich Residenz complex on the edge of Munich\\'s Old Town now ranks among Europe\\'s most significant museums of interior decoration. Within the  is the splendid Cuvilliés Theatre and next door is the National Theatre Munich. Among the mansions that still exist in Munich are the Palais Porcia, the Palais Preysing, the Palais Holnstein and the Prinz-Carl-Palais. All mansions are situated close to the , so is the Alter Hof, the first residence of the House of Wittelsbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nModernist architecture\\r\\nDespite Munich being the breeding ground for German Jugendstil, starting with the architect Martin Dülfer, Munich Jugendstil style was quickly submerged in historic trash. While the modernist architect Theodor Fischer was based in Munich, his influence on Munich underwhelmed. Prior to 1914 the city of Munich was under-industrialized. During the Weimar Republic, the Munich establishment was hostile to modernism. thumb|Streets in Central MunichThe TUM professor German Bestelmeyer favored a conservative style, and Jacobus Oud was rejected for the post of city building chief. Modernist exceptions include a series of post offices by Robert Vorhoelzer built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Examples of avant-garde temporary constructions include the Wohnmaschine (Housing Machine) by Robert Vorhoelzer, as well as the Flachdachhaus (Flat Roof House) by Fritz Norkauer. Paul Schultze-Naumburg, and the Kampfbund enjoyed particular popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh rise buildings\\r\\nthumb|right|The Sheraton hotel and the HVB Tower at Arabellapark\\r\\nSeveral high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the HVB Tower, the Arabella High-Rise Building, the Highlight Towers, Uptown Munich, Münchner Tor and the BMW Headquarters next to the Olympic Park. Further high-rise buildings are located in the  in Berg am Laim.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-term residential development \\r\\nMunich is subject to a long-term residential development plan that is established by the city administration of Munich. The LaSie (\"Langfristige Siedlungsentwicklung\") was passed in 2011 in response to the acute housing crisis. LaSie is aligned with the strategic development plan passed for Munich in 1998 (\"Perspektive München\"). LaSie defines three priorities for the construction of residential housing in Munich. Existing housing estates, post-war low-density developments, and the suburban area are subject to densification (\"Nachverdichtung\"). Non-residential industrial areas are subject to conservation and will be turned into residential and mixed-use areas. On greenfield sites in the Munich periphery medium and large-scale housing estates are to be built so as to extend Munich\\'s urban center.\\r\\n\\r\\nParks\\r\\nthumb|Olympiapark, public viewing during FIFA World Cup 2006\\r\\nFriedrich Ludwig von Sckell became famous for designing the Englischer Garten between 1789 and 1807. Besides planning the first public garden in Europe, Sckell also redesigned Baroque gardens as landscape gardens, including the parks of Nymphenburg Palace and the Botanischer Garten München-Nymphenburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther large green spaces are the Olympiapark, the Westpark and the Ostpark. The city\\'s oldest park is the Hofgarten, near the Residenz, dating back to the 16th century. The site of the largest beer garden in town, the former royal Hirschgarten, was founded in 1780.\\r\\n\\r\\nSports\\r\\n\\r\\nFootball\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Allianz Arena, also the home stadium of FC Bayern Munich\\r\\nthumb|Olympiasee in Olympiapark, Munich\\r\\nMunich is home to several professional Association football teams including the FC Bayern Munich. Other notable clubs include 1860 Munich, who currently play in the 3. Liga, and former Bundesliga club SpVgg Unterhaching, who currently play in the 3. Liga.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasketball\\r\\nFC Bayern Munich Basketball is currently playing in the Beko Basket Bundesliga. The city hosted the final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1993, where the German national basketball team won the gold medal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce hockey\\r\\nThe city\\'s ice hockey club is EHC Red Bull München who play in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. The team has won three DEL Championships, in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympics\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics; the Munich massacre took place in the Olympic village. It was one of the host cities for the 2006 Football World Cup, which was not held in Munich\\'s Olympic Stadium, but in a new football specific stadium, the Allianz Arena. Munich bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, but lost to Pyeongchang. In September 2011 the DOSB President Thomas Bach confirmed that Munich would bid again for the Winter Olympics in the future. These plans were abandoned some time later.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoad running\\r\\nRegular annual road running events in Munich are the Munich Marathon in October, the Stadtlauf end of June, the company run B2Run in July, the New Year\\'s Run on 31 December, the Spartan Race Sprint, the Olympia Alm Crosslauf and the Bestzeitenmarathon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwimming\\r\\nthumb|Olympia Schwimmhalle\\r\\nPublic sporting facilities in Munich include ten indoor swimming pools and eight outdoor swimming pools, which are operated by the Munich City Utilities (SWM) communal company. Popular indoor swimming pools include the Olympia Schwimmhalle of the 1972 Summer Olympics, the wave pool Cosimawellenbad, as well as the Müllersches Volksbad which was built in 1901. Further, swimming within Munich\\'s city limits is also possible in several artificial lakes such as for example the Riemer See or the Langwieder lake district.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiver surfing\\r\\nthumb|Surfer on the Eisbach river wave\\r\\nRiver surfing is a popular sport in Munich. The Flosskanal wave in the south of Munich is less challenging. A well visited surfing spot for experienced surfers is the Eisbach standing wave, where the annual Munich Surf Open is celebrated on the last Saturday of July.\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture\\r\\n\\r\\nLanguage\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman is spoken and understood in and around Munich. While the German language has many dialects, so called \"high German\" is learned in schools and spoken among Germans, Austrians and in some parts of Switzerland. A speaker of a so-called \"low German\" dialect in Hamburg may find it difficult to understand the dialect of a Bavarian mountaineer. The Bavarian dialects are recognized as regional language and continues to be spoken alongside \"high German\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMuseums\\r\\nthumb|right|Deutsches Museum\\r\\nthumb|The Glyptothek\\r\\nThe gothic Morris dancers of Erasmus Grasser are exhibited in the Munich City Museum in the old gothic arsenal building in the inner city.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1903 Oskar von Miller assembled a group of engineers and industrialists, who chartered the Deutsches Museum. The Museum was built with the financial support of the German business and imperial nobility community, as well as the blessing of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. The Deutsches Museum had its grand opening in 1925, but has undergone a reinvention recently. The Deutsches Museum now operates three locations. The original site in central Munich continues to expand its exhibits.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|left|upright|Bavarian National Museum\\r\\nThe city has several important art galleries, most of which can be found in the Kunstareal. The Lenbachhaus displays works of the movement Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a Munich-based modernist art.\\r\\nStarting in 1970s, German municipalities started to respond to cultural tourism and invested in public museums. The Neue Pinakothek, like other German museums, was wholly reconstructed from 1974 until 1981. The Pinakothek der Moderne lets the public see an eclectic mix of contemporary art and the principle attention of the permanent collection is Classical Moderns. But the displays are enhanced continuously with spectacular gifts from private collections.\\r\\n\\r\\nCity guides published in the early 1860s directed tourists to Munich\\'s architecture and art collections, which at the time were unique in Germany and are a legacy mainly of Ludwig I of Bavaria, with contributions from Maximilian II of Bavaria. The Alte Pinakothek contains works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. Major displays include Albrecht Dürer\\'s Self-Portrait (1500), his Four Apostles, Raphael\\'s paintings The Canigiani Holy Family and Madonna Tempi as well as Peter Paul Rubens large Judgment Day.   \\r\\nthumbnail|BMW Welt\\r\\nAn extensive collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the Glyptothek and the Staatliche Antikensammlungen (the State Antiquities Collections). Works on display include the Medusa Rondanini, the Barberini Faun and figures from the Temple of Aphaea on Aegina for the Glyptothek. Another interesting museum is the Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst (the State Collection of Egyptian Art).\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral public collections of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich are still housed in the Kunstareal. The expanded state collections are housed in the Paläontologisches Museum München, and the Zoologische Staatssammlung München. After the first German art exhibition in the Glaspalast for an international audience in 1869, Munich emerged as a focal point for the arts. Men of distinction from around the world visited the Academy of Fine Arts under the directorship of Karl von Piloty and later Wilhelm von Kaulbach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Museum Five Continents is the second largest collection in Germany of artefacts and objects from outside Europe, while the Bavarian National Museum and the adjoining Bavarian State Archaeological Collection display regional art and cultural history. The Schackgalerie is an important gallery of German 19th-century paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe memorial museum of the former Dachau concentration camp is just outside the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic\\r\\nthumb|National Theatre\\r\\nMunich is a major international musical centre and has played host to many prominent composers including Orlande de Lassus, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Carl Maria von Weber, Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Max Reger and Carl Orff. Some of classical music\\'s best-known compositions have been created in and around Munich by composers born in the area, for example, Richard Strauss\\'s tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra or Carl Orff\\'s Carmina Burana.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpera\\r\\nthumb|Gasteig\\r\\nRichard Wagner was a supporter of William I, German Emperor, but Wagner only found a generous patron in Ludwig II of Bavaria. 1870 til 1871 Wagner premiered Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg) in Munich, a popular success for Wagner and King Ludwig II. Wagner premiered at the Hoftheater, now the National Theatre Munich, with Angelo Quaglio the Younger designing the premiere production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Theatre Munich is now the home of the Bavarian State Opera and the Bavarian State Orchestra. Next door, the modern Residenz Theatre was erected in the building that also houses the Cuvilliés Theatre. The Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz is a state theater while another opera house, the Prinzregententheater, has become the home of the Bavarian Theater Academy and the Munich Chamber Orchestra.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrchestra\\r\\nThe modern Gasteig centre houses the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. Its primary concert venue is the Herkulessaal in the former city royal residence, the Munich Residenz. Many important conductors have been attracted by the city\\'s orchestras, including Felix Weingartner, Hans Pfitzner, Hans Rosbaud, Hans Knappertsbusch, Sergiu Celibidache, James Levine, Christian Thielemann, Lorin Maazel, Rafael Kubelík, Eugen Jochum, Sir Colin Davis, Mariss Jansons, Bruno Walter, Georg Solti, Zubin Mehta and Kent Nagano. A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the Deutsche Theater. It is Germany\\'s largest theatre for guest performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|The Golden Friedensengel\\r\\n\\r\\nPop and electronica\\r\\nMunich was the centre of Krautrock in southern Germany, with many important bands such as Amon Düül II, Embryo or Popol Vuh hailing from the city. In the 1970s, the Musicland Studios developed into one of the most prominent recording studios in the world, with bands such as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Queen recording albums there. Munich also played a significant role in the development of electronic music, with genre pioneer Giorgio Moroder, who invented synth disco and electronic dance music, and Donna Summer, one of disco music\\'s most important performers, both living and working in the city. In the late 1990s, Electroclash was substantially co-invented if not even invented in Munich, when DJ Hell introduced and assembled international pioneers of this musical genre through his International DeeJay Gigolo Records label here.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable musicians and bands from Munich include Konstantin Wecker, Willy Astor, Spider Murphy Gang, Münchener Freiheit, Lou Bega, Megaherz, FSK, Colour Haze and Sportfreunde Stiller.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich hosted several Love Parades and Mayday Party rave events throughout the 1990s. Munich continues to rave, the local youth scenes are active.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheatre\\r\\nThe Munich Kammerspiele is one of the most important German-language theaters. Since Gotthold Ephraim Lessing\\'s premieres in 1775 many important writers have staged their plays in Munich, they include Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Henrik Ibsen, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchwabing\\r\\nthumb|Wassily Kandinsky\\'s Houses in Munich (1908)\\r\\nAt the turn of the 20th century Schwabing was a preeminent cultural metropolis. Schwabing was an epicenter for both literature and the fine arts, with numerous German and non-German artists living there.\\r\\n\\r\\nVladimir Lenin authored What Is to Be Done? while living in Schwabing. Central to Schwabing\\'s bohemian scene were Künstlerlokale (Artist\\'s Cafés) like Café Stefanie or Kabarett Simpl, whose liberal ways differed fundamentally from Munich\\'s more traditional localities. The Simpl, which survives to this day, was named after Munich\\'s anti-authoritarian satirical magazine Simplicissimus, founded in 1896 by Albert Langen and Thomas Theodor Heine, which quickly became an important organ of the Schwabinger Bohème. Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on Wilhelmine German society were the result of countless of collaborative efforts by many of the best visual artists and writers from Munich and elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971 Eckart Witzigmann teamed up with a Munich building contractor to finance and open the Tantris restaurant in Schwabing. Witzigmann is credited for starting the German Küchenwunder (kitchen wonder).\\r\\n\\r\\nBiedermeier\\r\\nThe Biedermeier era was named after a character that regularly appeared in the satire magazine Münchner Fliegende Blätter (Loose Munich Pages), which was published by Adolf Kussmaul and Ludwig Eichrodt in Munich between 1855 and 1857. Biedermeier was a synonym for arts, furniture, and the lifestyle of the nonheroic middle class. The Biedermeier era painters Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, Moritz von Schwind, and Carl Spitzweg are shown in the Neue Pinakothek.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinzregentenzeit\\r\\nCelebrity literary figures worked in Munich especially during the final decades of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the so-called Prinzregentenzeit (literally prince regent\\'s time) under the reign of Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. This includes Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Paul Johann Ludwig von Heyse, Rainer Maria Rilke, Ludwig Thoma, Fanny zu Reventlow, Oskar Panizza, Gustav Meyrink, Max Halbe, Erich Mühsam and Frank Wedekind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeimar Republic\\r\\nthumb|upright|Portrait of Oskar Maria Graf by Georg Schrimpf (1927)\\r\\nThe period immediately before World War I saw continued economic and cultural prominence for the city. Thomas Mann wrote in his novella Gladius Dei about this period: \"München leuchtete\" (literally \"Munich shone\"). Munich remained a centre of cultural life during the Weimar Republic, with figures such as Lion Feuchtwanger, Bertolt Brecht, Peter Paul Althaus, Stefan George, Ricarda Huch, Joachim Ringelnatz, Oskar Maria Graf, Annette Kolb, Ernst Toller, Hugo Ball, and Klaus Mann adding to the already established big names.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl Valentin, the cabaret performer and comedian, is to this day remembered and beloved as a cultural icon of his hometown. Between 1910 and 1940, he wrote and performed in many absurdist sketches and short films that were highly influential, earning him the nickname of \"Charlie Chaplin of Germany\".\\r\\n\\r\\nLiesl Karlstadt, before working together with Valentin, cross-dressed and performed cabaret with yodeling on stage and in Munich\\'s Cafe-Theatres. The cabaret scene was crushed when the Nazis seized power in 1933 and Karlstadt was saved from Nazi sterilization by a doctor. Contemporary Munich cabaret still reverences 1920s cabaret, the Munich alternative rock band F.S.K. absorbs yodels.\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-war literature\\r\\nAfter World War II, Munich soon again became a focal point of the German literary scene and remains so to this day, with writers as diverse as Wolfgang Koeppen, Erich Kästner, Eugen Roth, Alfred Andersch, Elfriede Jelinek, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Michael Ende, Franz Xaver Kroetz, Gerhard Polt and Patrick Süskind calling the city their home.\\r\\n\\r\\nFine arts\\r\\nFrom the Gothic to the Baroque era, the fine arts were represented in Munich by artists like Erasmus Grasser, Jan Polack, Johann Baptist Straub, Ignaz Günther, Hans Krumpper, Ludwig von Schwanthaler, Cosmas Damian Asam, Egid Quirin Asam, Johann Baptist Zimmermann, Johann Michael Fischer and François de Cuvilliés. Munich had already become an important place for painters like Carl Rottmann, Lovis Corinth, Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Carl Spitzweg, Franz von Lenbach, Franz Stuck, Karl Piloty and Wilhelm Leibl.\\r\\n\\r\\nCinema\\r\\nMunich was (and in some cases, still is) home to many of the most important authors of the New German Cinema movement, including Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Edgar Reitz and Herbert Achternbusch. In 1971, the Filmverlag der Autoren was founded, cementing the city\\'s role in the movement\\'s history. Munich served as the location for many of Fassbinder\\'s films, among them Ali: Fear Eats the Soul. The Hotel Deutsche Eiche near Gärtnerplatz was somewhat like a centre of operations for Fassbinder and his \"clan\" of actors. New German Cinema is considered by far the most important artistic movement in German cinema history since the era of German Expressionism in the 1920s.\\r\\nthumb|Logo of Bavaria Film\\r\\nIn 1919, the Bavaria Film Studios were founded, which developed into one of Europe\\'s largest film studios. Directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, Orson Welles, John Huston, Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Claude Chabrol, Fritz Umgelter, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Wolfgang Petersen and Wim Wenders made films there. Among the internationally well-known films produced at the studios are The Pleasure Garden (1925) by Alfred Hitchcock, The Great Escape (1963) by John Sturges, Paths of Glory (1957) by Stanley Kubrick, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) by Mel Stuart and both Das Boot (1981) and The Neverending Story (1984) by Wolfgang Petersen. Munich remains one of the centres of the German film and entertainment industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFestivals\\r\\nthumb|Oktoberfest\\r\\n\\r\\nCoopers\\' Dance\\r\\nthumb|right|200px|Schäfflertanz in Neuhausen, 2012\\r\\nThe Coopers\\' Dance () is a guild dance of coopers originally started in Munich.

The dance was supposed to be held every 7 years.\"Gründungsmythos der Schäffler: So wahr wie die offiziellen Abgaswerte der Autoindustrie\" , Sueddeutsche Zeitung (\"Cooper\\'s founding myth: As true as the official emissions values of the automotive industry\"), February 19, 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nStarkbierfest\\r\\nMarch and April, for three weeks during Lent, celebrating Munich\\'s \"strong beer\". Starkbier was created in 1651 by the local Paulinerkirche, Leipzig monks who drank this \\'Flüssiges Brot\\', or \\'liquid bread\\'. It became a public festival in 1751 and is now the second largest beer festival in Munich. A Starkbierfest may be celebrated in beer halls and pubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrühlingsfest\\r\\nHeld for two weeks at the Theresienwiese from the end of April to the beginning of May, the new local spring beers are served.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuer Dult\\r\\n\\r\\nA regular event combining a market and a German style folk festival on the Mariahilfplatz.

In the last 200 years the festival has grown to span 85 acres and now welcomes over 6 million visitors every year. Beer is served from the six major Munich breweries. These are Augustiner-Bräu, Hacker-Pschorr Brewery, Löwenbräu Brewery, Paulaner Brewery, Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu, and Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München. Food must be bought in each tent.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristkindlmarkt\\r\\nThe Munich Christkindlmarkt started to evolve in the 14th century. The German Christkindlmarkt reached the desired accomplishment in the 17th century in Nuremberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nCuisine and culinary specialities\\r\\nthumb|Weisswurst with sweet mustard and a pretzel\\r\\nThe Munich cuisine contributes to the Bavarian cuisine. Munich Weisswurst (\"white sausage\", German: Münchner Weißwurst) was invented here in 1857. It is a Munich speciality. Traditionally Weisswurst is served in pubs before noon and is served with sweet mustard and freshly baked pretzels.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich has 11 restaurants that have been awarded one or more Michelin Guide stars in 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeers and breweries\\r\\nthumb|left|Helles beer\\r\\nthumb|Augustiner brewery\\r\\nthumb|left|Beer garden in Munich\\r\\nMunich is known for its breweries and Weissbier (wheat beer). Helles, a pale lager with a translucent gold color, is the most popular contemporary Munich beer. Helles has largely replaced Munich\\'s dark beer, known as Dunkel, which gets its color from roasted malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with a high alcohol content of 6%–9%. It is dark amber in color and has a heavy malty taste. The beer served at Oktoberfest is a special type of beer with a higher alcohol content.\\r\\n\\r\\nWirtshäuser are traditional Bavarian pubs, many of which also have small outside areas. Biergärten (beer gardens) are a popular fixture in Munich\\'s gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city\\'s culture, and are an overt melting pot for members of all walks of life, regardless of social class. There are many smaller beer gardens, but some beer gardens have thousands of seats. Large beer gardens can be found in the Englischer Garten, on the Nockherberg, and in the Hirschgarten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are six main breweries in Munich are Augustiner-Bräu, Hacker-Pschorr Brewery, Hofbräuhaus, Löwenbräu, Paulaner, and Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu. Smaller breweries are becoming more prevalent in Munich.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircus\\r\\nThe Circus Krone based in Munich is one of the largest circuses in Europe. It was the first and still is one of only a few in Western Europe to also occupy a building of its own.\\r\\n\\r\\nNightlife\\r\\nthumb|The party ship Alte Utting\\r\\nNightlife in Munich is located mostly in the boroughs Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, Maxvorstadt, Au-Haidhausen, Berg am Laim and Sendling. Between Sendlinger Tor and Maximiliansplatz, on the edge of the central Altstadt-Lehel district, there is also the so-called Feierbanane (party banana), a roughly banana-shaped unofficial party zone spanning  along Sonnenstraße, characterized by a high concentration of clubs, bars and restaurants, which became the center of Munich\\'s nightlife in the mid-2000s.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Bahnwärter Thiel\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Schwabing was considered a center of nightlife in Germany, with internationally known clubs such as Big Apple, PN hit-house, Domicile, Hot Club, Piper Club, Tiffany, Germany\\'s first large-scale discotheque Blow Up and the underwater nightclub Yellow Submarine, and Munich has been called \"New York\\'s big disco sister\" in this context. Bars in the Schwabing district of this era include, among many others, Schwabinger 7 and Schwabinger Podium. Since the 1980s, however, Schwabing has lost much of its nightlife activity due to gentrification and the resulting high rents, and the formerly wild artists\\' and students\\' quarter developed into one of the city\\'s most coveted and expensive residential districts, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, the Rosa Viertel (pink quarter) developed in the Glockenbachviertel and around Gärtnerplatz, which in the 1980s made Munich \"one of the four gayest metropolises in the world\" along with San Francisco, New York City and Amsterdam. In particular, the area around Müllerstraße and Hans-Sachs-Straße was characterized by numerous gay bars and nightclubs. One of them was the travesty nightclub Old Mrs. Henderson, where Freddie Mercury, who lived in Munich from 1979 to 1985, filmed the music video for the song Living on My Own at his 39th birthday party.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the mid-1990s, the Kunstpark Ost and its successor Kultfabrik, a former industrial complex that was converted to a large party area near München Ostbahnhof in Berg am Laim, hosted more than 30 clubs and was especially popular among younger people from the metropolitan area surrounding Munich and tourists. The Kultfabrik was closed at the end of the year 2015 to convert the area into a residential and office area. Apart from the Kultfarbik and the smaller Optimolwerke, there is a wide variety of establishments in the urban parts of nearby Haidhausen. Before the Kunstpark Ost, there had already been an accumulation of internationally known nightclubs in the remains of the abandoned former Munich-Riem Airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|Blitz Club on Museumsinsel\\r\\nMunich nightlife tends to change dramatically and quickly. Establishments open and close every year, and due to gentrification and the overheated housing market many survive only a few years, while others last longer. Beyond the already mentioned venues of the 1960s and 1970s, nightclubs with international recognition in recent history included Tanzlokal Größenwahn, Atomic Cafe and the techno clubs Babalu Club, Ultraschall, , , , Die Registratur and Bob Beaman. From 1995 to 2001, Munich was also home to the Union Move, one of the largest technoparades in Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunich has the highest density of music venues of any German city, followed by Hamburg, Cologne and Berlin. Within the city\\'s limits are more than 100 nightclubs and thousands of bars and restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome notable nightclubs are: popular techno clubs are Blitz Club, Harry Klein, Rote Sonne, Bahnwärter Thiel, Pimpernel, Charlie, Palais and Pathos. Popular mixed music clubs are Call me Drella, Wannda Circus, Tonhalle, Backstage, Muffathalle, Ampere, Pacha, P1, Zenith, Minna Thiel and the party ship Alte Utting. Some notable bars (pubs are located all over the city) are Schumann\\'s Bar, Havana Club, Sehnsucht, Bar Centrale, Holy Home, Negroni, Die Goldene Bar and Bei Otto.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\n\\r\\nColleges and universities\\r\\nthumb|Main building of the LMU\\r\\nthumb|Main building of the Technical University\\r\\nthumb|University of Applied Sciences (HM)\\r\\nthumb|Academy of Fine Arts Munich\\r\\nMunich is a leading location for science and research with a long list of Nobel Prize laureates from Wilhelm Röntgen in 1901 to Theodor W.

It is used by about 46\\xa0million passengers a year, and lies some  north east of the city centre. It replaced the smaller Munich-Riem Airport in 1992. The airport can be reached by suburban train lines from the city. From the main railway station the journey takes 40–45 minutes. An express train will be added that will cut down travel time to 20–25 minutes with limited stops on dedicated tracks. A magnetic levitation train (called Transrapid), which was to have run at speeds of up to  from the central station to the airport in a travel time of 10 minutes, had been approved, but was cancelled in March 2008 because of cost escalation and after heavy protests. Lufthansa opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther airports\\r\\nIn 2008, the Bavarian state government granted a licence to expand Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station located west of Munich, for commercial use. These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local Government, including the city of Munich, which took the case to court. However, in October 2009, the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being  from Munich, Memmingen Airport has been advertised as Airport Munich West. After 2005, passenger traffic of nearby Augsburg Airport was relocated to Munich Airport, leaving the Augsburg region of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround Munich\\r\\n\\r\\nNearby towns\\r\\nThe Munich agglomeration sprawls across the plain of the Alpine foothills comprising about 2.6\\xa0million inhabitants. Several smaller traditional Bavarian towns and cities like Dachau, Freising, Erding, Starnberg, Landshut and Moosburg are today part of the Greater Munich Region, formed by Munich and the surrounding districts, making up the Munich Metropolitan Region, which has a population of about 6\\xa0million people.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecreation\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of Munich, there are numerous nearby freshwater lakes such as Lake Starnberg, Ammersee, Chiemsee, Walchensee, Kochelsee, Tegernsee, Schliersee, Simssee, Staffelsee, Wörthsee, Kirchsee and the Osterseen (Easter Lakes), which are popular among Munich residents for recreation, swimming and watersports and can be quickly reached by car and a few also by Munich\\'s S-Bahn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable people\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in
